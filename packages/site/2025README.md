# Overall Thoughts For 2025

We're off to a great start!

I've left a variety of comments in this repo. Some should be tickets. Some might
just be comments, or a few comments could be lumped into one ticket.

What I've done for now is create one ticket, and a link back to this branch.

I'll summarize the work in the ticket, but will not create a ticket for every
piece I've highlighted (aside from one or two big items we 100% have to do).

I'm leaving some decions up to the team. Should we do everything listed in this
branch? Maybe not.

Don't merge this branch. It's just for comments.
