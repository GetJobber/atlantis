# BottomSheet

# BottomSheet

BottomSheet uses an overlay to focus attention to the user on the options
available after triggering a button. This helps isolate the decision-making that
a user has to make at each step of their interaction. BottomSheet is used to
bring up a modal from the bottom that will contain whatever children are passed
to it. Its height will be defined by the component that is passed to it.

## Design & usage guidelines

For the most part, a BottomSheet will be used in cases where the user is
choosing from a menu offering additional functionality related to onscreen
items.

In certain scenarios, you may need to add a title or an explicit option to
cancel the BottomSheet.

### Cancel

A **cancel action** should only be used in cases where:

- an action will _actually_ be cancelled; if the only thing tapping "cancel"
  will do is close the BottomSheet, don't use cancel
- it is not inherently obvious that tapping out of the BottomSheet will _not_
  complete the desired preceding action initiated

### Heading

Add a **heading** to the BottomSheet in cases where the user has initiated a
preceding action which could result in a state change. In this case, the title
should repeat the preceding action label.

## Content guidelines

BottomSheetOption follows the same content guidelines as the web
