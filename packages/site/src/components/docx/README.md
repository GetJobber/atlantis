# Why are these duplicated here?

These were the only files we couldn't figure out how to import cleanly from this
project. Mainly due to vite and the css module situation. The existing docx
files use css modules that don't have .modules in the name.

In addition to that, I felt these components should probably be re-integrated
into normal components or refactored into ones we do want to do that with.
Bringing them here is step 1 towards that goal.

We are open to other suggestions here!
