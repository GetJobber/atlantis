# Cover

The Cover component helps you create fixed-height layouts with the option for
vertically centered content. It's great for creating hero sections, marketing
callouts, or any layout where you want content to fill the available vertical
space.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Cover when you need to:

- Create full-height layouts with centered content
- Build hero sections or splash screens
- Display content that should fill the available vertical space

## Basic example

<Canvas>
  <Cover minHeight="50vh">
    <Text>Content above</Text>
    <Cover.Center>
      <Heading>Welcome back!</Heading>
      <Text>Sign in to continue to your account.</Text>
    </Cover.Center>
    <Text>Content below</Text>
  </Cover>
</Canvas>

### Cover.Center

Use `Cover.Center` to vertically center content within the Cover component.
Content within `Cover.Center` will be automatically centered in the available
space.

<Canvas>
  <Cover minHeight="40vh">
    <Cover.Center>
      <Heading>Welcome back!</Heading>
      <Text>Sign in to continue to your account.</Text>
    </Cover.Center>
  </Cover>
</Canvas>

## Best practices

- Use meaningful minimum heights that make sense for your content
- Consider the viewport height (`vh`) units for full-screen covers
- Ensure content within `Cover.Center` is properly structured for vertical
  centering
