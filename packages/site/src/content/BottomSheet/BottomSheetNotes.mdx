## Configuration

BottomSheet uses an internal BottomSheetOption to provide a preset pairing of an
Icon and an ActionLabel.

By default, the `<BottomSheet />` is not visible on the screen. To open the
`<BottomSheet />`, you need to add a `ref` attribute on it and call
`ref.current.open()`.

### onClose

Do not use `ref.current?.close()` inside the onClose callback. This could create
an infinite loop.
