## Platform considerations

### Event Handlers

While Checkbox exposes mouse event handlers like `onClick`, the recommended way
to access the new value is via the `onChange` prop.

### CheckboxGroup (mobile)

The `<CheckboxGroup>` component is a component that provides a grouping of
checkboxes. It allows you to optionally provide a label which will allow you to
control the Checkbox children with a single parent checkbox. If some but not all
children are checked then the parent checkbox will show the indeterminate state.
An important thing to note is that when using `<CheckboxGroup>` the child
Checkboxes must have a name provided as a prop. This is so the CheckboxGroup is
able to keep track the state of the child Checkboxes. See
