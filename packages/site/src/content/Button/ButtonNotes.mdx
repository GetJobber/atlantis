## Configuration

### Client-side routing (web only)

A Button can be used for client-side routing as well. When using a Button to
handle the client-side routing, use the `to` prop. Notice when you click below
that the URL will change to the appropriate route. See
[Web/Client Side Routing example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-web--client-side-routing).

### Form submit (web only)

Passing the `submit` prop will allow a Button to submit a
[Form](/components/Form). Since submitting a form is a specific action, only a
form is a specific action, only `variation="work"` and `type="primary"` are
allowed. See
[Web/Form Submit example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-web--form-submit)

Since this type of `Button` will only be used to submit a form, it does not make
sense to allow the `external`, `onClick`, `to`, or `url` props.
