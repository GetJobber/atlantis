# Stack

The Stack component creates a vertical layout of elements with consistent
spacing between them. It's one of the fundamental layout components in Atlantis
that helps create clean, organized interfaces.

The Stack differs from our legacy Content component in that it's not tackling
multiple use cases. The Stack only manages vertical spacing between elements.
Content also managed the padding around the edges of the content, which is now
handled by Box. Splitting the two components allows them both to be more
flexible and useful than before.

## When to use

Use Stack when you need to:

- Create vertical layouts with consistent spacing
- Build forms with evenly spaced fields
- Layout content in cards or modals
- Create sections with equal vertical rhythm

## Examples

### Basic Stack

<Canvas>
  <Stack>
    <Text>First item</Text>
    <Text>Second item</Text>
    <Text>Third item</Text>
  </Stack>
</Canvas>

### Custom Spacing

<Canvas>
  <Stack gap="large">
    <Text>More space</Text>
    <Text>Between items</Text>
  </Stack>
</Canvas>

### Split Layout

<Canvas>
  <Box height={200}>
    <Stack splitAfter={2}>
      <Text>Main content</Text>
      <Text>Secondary content</Text>
      <Text>Footer content</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Recursive Spacing

<Canvas>
  <Stack gap="large" recursive>
    <Box>
      <Text>Nested item 1.1</Text>
      <Text>Nested item 1.2</Text>
    </Box>
    <Box>
      <Text>Nested item 2.1</Text>
      <Text>Nested item 2.2</Text>
    </Box>
  </Stack>
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Stack uses semantic HTML and maintains proper spacing for readability. The
component preserves the natural document flow, ensuring good keyboard navigation
and screen reader compatibility.
