## Developer notes

Some functionality that we have opted not to introduce at this time, but that
would be relatively feasible to add in the future:

- allow for the concept of a date-range selection
- allow for certain days or dates to be excluded from selection

### Web

InputDate pairs with the AtlantisContext using the provided `firstDayOfWeek`
value to determine what day the calendar date picking UI will use to start
weeks.

To leverage this behavior, implement the AtlantisContext at the root of the
application, populated with the applicable value.
