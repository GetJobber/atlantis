## Developer notes

Some functionality that we have opted not to introduce at this time, but that
would be relatively feasible to add in the future:

- allow for the concept of a date-range selection
- allow for certain days or dates to be excluded from selection

### Web

InputDate pairs with the
<a href="https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/tree/master/packages/components/src/AtlantisContext" target="_blank">AtlantisContext</a>
using the provided `firstDayOfWeek` value to determine what day the calendar
date picking UI will use to start weeks.

To leverage this behavior, implement the
<a href="https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/tree/master/packages/components/src/AtlantisContext" target="_blank">AtlantisContext</a>
at the root of the application, populated with the applicable value.
