## Developer notes

There is an [Autolink](https://github.com/joshswan/react-native-autolink)
package written by a third party that was investigated to accomplish what this
component does. Though we were able to provide our own rendering function to
display our own text instead of RN Text, this still required re-writing a good
chunk of functionality and still importing the base library to get the proper
types. Also contained extra things we didn't need. This package was used as
inspiration into dealing with this problem and building our own.
