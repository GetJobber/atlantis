# Card

A card is used to group related information and tasks so our users can scan and
prioritize information more easily.

## Design & usage guidelines

A card is useful for grouping content because of its distinct visual boundaries.
However, similar to the idea that "making everything stand out means that
nothing stands out", you should be mindful in your application of cards.

A card should be the smallest-possible self-contained section of content. If you
find yourself putting a card inside of another card, the outer card should be
removed, and it may be worth re-assessing the hierarchy of your interface.

### Clickable

If clicking on the entire Card will navigate the user to a new view or perform
an action, the Card will have interactive hover and focus states.

It is important to signify to the user that the Card is clickable. This can be
done by using elevation or by using the `arrowRight` chevron icon in the Card.
Common examples of this pattern can be found in the
[Card Figma.](https://www.figma.com/design/rIIhulZvcp9M82lNOCGv16/Product%2FOnline?m=auto&node-id=22677-10476&t=YbmsOsxL9J6ggqVA-1)

### Elevation

By default, it should be assumed that a Card is on the same "plane" as the
surface it sits on and has no elevation.

If the Card benefits from having elevation indicated, such as when it sits
overtop another Card or is used in a Carousel fashion, the appropriate elevation
level can be set. See
[Mobile/Elevation](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-card-mobile--elevation)
for an example.

## Related components

[Content](/components/Content) and [Flex](/components/Flex) are the most common
layout tools for managing the Card's children. Generally, Card is un-opinionated
about what goes inside of it.

If you require more customization over the appearance of your container,
[Box](/components/Box) is the preferred way to achieve this without writing CSS.

## Content guidelines

Card headers should be sentence-cased.

| ✅ Do                   | ❌ Don't                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Client property details | Client Property Details |
| Assigned team           | ASSIGNED TEAM           |
| Required deposit        | Required Deposit        |

As previously mentioned, a Card should be "self-contained" and nesting Cards
inside of other Cards should be avoided.

## Accessibility

The Card itself is already accessible and does not require any additional setup.

With that said, it should not be wrapped in an element with an `aria-label` or
`accessibilityLabel` describing it as a card. This is redundant and will cause
unexpected behaviour for screen readers. For example, wrapping a Card with an
`accessibilityLabel` on mobile hides the entire Card from screen readers.
