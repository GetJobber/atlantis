## Configuration

### Card Types

The Card component supports three distinct types of cards:

1. **Regular Card** - A basic card without any click behavior
2. **Link Card** - A card that navigates to a URL when clicked
3. **Clickable Card** - A card that triggers a custom click handler

### Component Customization

#### Composable Usage

The Card component supports both prop-driven and composable approaches. The
standard prop-driven usage with `title` and `header` props is straightforward
and suitable for most use cases. For advanced customization needs, the Card
component also provides `Card.Header` and `Card.Body` components.

`Card.Header` is used to display custom header content of the card. `Card.Body`
is used to display the main content of the card.

Here's an example of converting a prop-driven card to a composable one when more
customization is needed:

```tsx
<Card title="Card Title" header="Header Text">
  <p>Card content</p>
</Card>
```

becomes

```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Card Title</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Card content</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

#### Link Card Example

```tsx
<Card url="/dashboard" external={true}>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>External Link</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Click to navigate to dashboard</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

#### Clickable Card Example

```tsx
<Card onClick={handleClick}>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Interactive Card</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Click to trigger action</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

### Props Compatibility

The Card component uses a discriminated union pattern to ensure proper usage.
This means that the component can be one of three distinct types, each with its
own set of valid props:

- A Link Card must have a `url` prop and cannot have an `onClick` handler
- A Clickable Card must have an `onClick` prop and cannot have a `url`
- A Regular Card has neither `url` nor `onClick`

This type system ensures that each card has a clear and single responsibility
for its interaction behavior, making it impossible to create ambiguous card
states (like having both a URL and click handler).

### Styling

Cards can be customized with the following props:

- `accent`: Applies an accent color to the card
- `elevation`: Controls the card's shadow elevation ("none" | "base" | "raised"
  | "floating")

Example with styling:

```tsx
<Card accent="purple" elevation="raised">
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Styled Card</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Card with purple accent and raised elevation</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```
