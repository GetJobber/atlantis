## Configuration

### Card Types

The Card component supports three distinct types of cards:

1. **Regular Card** - A basic card without any click behavior
2. **Link Card** - A card that navigates to a URL when clicked
3. **Clickable Card** - A card that triggers a custom click handler

### Component Customization

#### Composable Usage

The Card component supports both prop-driven and composable approaches. The
standard prop-driven usage with `title` and `header` props is straightforward
and suitable for most use cases. For advanced customization needs, the Card
component also provides `Card.Header` and `Card.Body` components.

`Card.Header` is used to display custom header content of the card. `Card.Body`
is used to display the main content of the card.

Here's an example of converting a prop-driven card to a composable one when more
customization is needed:

```tsx
<Card title="Card Title" header="Header Text">
  <p>Card content</p>
</Card>
```

becomes

```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Card Title</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Card content</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

#### Link Card Example

```tsx
<Card url="/dashboard" external={true}>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>External Link</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Click to navigate to dashboard</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

#### Clickable Card Example

```tsx
<Card onClick={handleClick}>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Interactive Card</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Click to trigger action</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

### Props Compatibility

The Card component uses a discriminated union pattern to ensure proper usage.
This means that the component can be one of three distinct types, each with its
own set of valid props:

- A Link Card must have a `url` prop and cannot have an `onClick` handler
- A Clickable Card must have an `onClick` prop and cannot have a `url`
- A Regular Card has neither `url` nor `onClick`

This type system ensures that each card has a clear and single responsibility
for its interaction behavior, making it impossible to create ambiguous card
states (like having both a URL and click handler).

### Styling

Cards can be customized with the following props:

- `accent`: Applies an accent color to the card
- `elevation`: Controls the card's shadow elevation ("none" | "base" | "raised"
  | "floating")

Example with styling:

```tsx
<Card accent="purple" elevation="raised">
  <Card.Header>
    <Text>Styled Card</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <p>Card with purple accent and raised elevation</p>
  </Card.Body>
</Card>
```

### UNSAFE\_ props (advanced usage)

General information for using `UNSAFE_` props can be found
[here](/guides/customizing-components).

Card has two elements that can be targeted with classes or styles. These are the
container and the header.

**Note**: Use of `UNSAFE_` props is **at your own risk** and should be
considered a **last resort**. Future Card updates may lead to unintended
breakages.

#### UNSAFE_className

Use `UNSAFE_className` to apply custom classes to the Card. This can be useful
for applying styles via CSS Modules.

```tsx
// YourComponent.tsx
<Card
  header="Custom Styled Card"
  UNSAFE_className={{
    container: styles.customCardContainer,
    header: styles.customCardHeader,
  }}
>
  <p>Card content with custom styling</p>
</Card>

// YourComponent.module.css
.customCardContainer {
  border: 2px solid var(--color-blue);
  border-radius: var(--radius-large);
}

.customCardHeader {
  background-color: var(--color-surface--background);
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-border);
}
```

#### UNSAFE_style

Use `UNSAFE_style` to apply inline custom styles to the Card.

```tsx
<Card
  header="Inline Styled Card"
  UNSAFE_style={{
    container: {
      backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--hover)",
      transform: "rotate(1deg)",
    },
    header: {
      backgroundColor: "var(--color-blue)",
      color: "white",
    },
  }}
>
  <p>Card content with inline styling</p>
</Card>
```

### Compound Component Card

If you're using Card with its composable subcomponents, note that currently
these subcomponents are simply fragments. As such, you are free to provide any
desired markup and have no need for either UNSAFE.

```
<Card>
 <Card.Header>
  <div className="custom" style={{padding: "var(--space-base)}}>
   <Heading level={3}>My Custom Header</Heading>
  </div>
 </Card.Header>
 <Card.Body>
  <div style={{ background: "#29d", padding: "var(--space-base)"}}>
   <Text>Card content</Text>
  </div>
 </Card.Body>
</Card>
```
