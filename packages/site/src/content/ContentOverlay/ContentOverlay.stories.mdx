# ContentOverlay

ContentOverlay allows the user to quickly access information that supports their
understanding of the primary content of their current view.

## Design & usage guidelines

The ContentOverlay component will allow users to quickly access detailed
information about a topic without having to navigate away from their current
view.

## Content guidelines

The ContentOverlay should be able to present any type of content, but its most
common use case will probably be text and images.

While the ContentOverlay can have input such as InputText within it, and the
keyboard will adjust its location to make the currently focused field visible,
it is advisable to be cautious about how much content it contains if there are
inputs. If an input ends up near the bottom of the ContentOverlay with no room
to move up, it will become obstructed by the keyboard. Only enabling scrolling
will allow it to be visible.

## Accessibility

ContentOverlay responds to touch events, specifically swiping.

## Responsiveness

ContentOverlay will take up as much vertical space as needed, minus a small
amount of space between the top of the overlay and the top of the screen. It
will also take up the full width of the screen up to a breakpoint of 640px,
where it will be a maximum width of 640px and be centered on the screen.
