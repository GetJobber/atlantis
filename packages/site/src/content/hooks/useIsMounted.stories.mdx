# UseIsMounted

`useIsMounted` should be used on asynchronous calls to ensure the component is
mounted before manipulating the state of that component. Manipulating the state
of unmounted components can cause errors and memory leaks.

If you want a function to be called one time after the component is mounted, you
should use `useOnMount` instead.

```tsx
import { useIsMounted } from "@jobber/hooks/useIsMounted";
```

<Canvas>
  <UseIsMounted />
</Canvas>
