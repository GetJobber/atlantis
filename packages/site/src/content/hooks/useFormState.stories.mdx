# UseFormState

`useFormState` is an extremely simple hook that wraps the
[useState()](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) hook and supplies some
default values.

`useFormState` should **only** only by used when using a
[`<Form />`](/components/Form) component.

```tsx
import { useFormState } from "@jobber/hooks/useFormState";
```

<Canvas>
  <UseFormState />
</Canvas>
