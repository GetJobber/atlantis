# UseCallbackRef

useCallbackRef converts a callback to a ref to avoid triggering re-renders when
passed as a prop or to avoid re-executing effects when passed as a dependency

```tsx
import { useOnMount } from "@jobber/hooks/useCallbackRef";

const callback = useCallbackRef(someFunction);
// callback is now a ref
```
