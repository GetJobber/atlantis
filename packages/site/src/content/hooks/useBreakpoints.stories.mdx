# useBreakpoints

```ts
import { useBreakpoints } from "@jobber/hooks/useBreakpoints";
```

`useBreakpoints` is the JS version of our
[Design/Breakpoints](/design/breakpoints) that uses `window.matchMedia` to mimic
the CSS media queries.

This allows you to use the same breakpoints in JS as you do in CSS. It also
returns a `smallOnly`, `mediumOnly`, and `largeOnly` boolean that you can use to
target specific breakpoints since JS doesn't cascade like CSS.

_Note: Resize your browser and to the values change_

## Testing

You can use the `mockViewportWidth` function to mock the window size and trigger
specific breakpoints.

```tsx
import {
  BREAKPOINT_SIZES,
  mockViewportWidth,
} from "@jobber/hooks/useBreakpoints";

const { cleanup, setViewportWidth } = mockViewportWidth();

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup();
});

it("should render my element when the viewport size is 500px", () => {
  // Set the viewport width before the component renders
  setViewportWidth(500);

  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText("500px")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

it("should render my element when the viewport size is large", () => {
  // Set the viewport width before the component renders
  setViewportWidth(BREAKPOINT_SIZES.lg);

  render(<MyComponent />);
  expect(screen.getByText("Large")).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
