# useOnKeyDown

`useOnKeyDown` is a simple hook that adds the `keydown` event handler when the
component is mounted and removed when unmounted.

`useOnKeyDown` should **only** be used when building keyboard shortcuts in a
component.

```tsx
import { useOnKeyDown } from "@jobber/hooks/useOnKeyDown";
```

You can specify a list of keys to watch including a key modifier with the event
handler.

<Canvas>
  <UseOnKeyDown />
</Canvas>
