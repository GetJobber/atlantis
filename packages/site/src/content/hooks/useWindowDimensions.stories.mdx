# useWindowDimensions

`useWindowDimensions` is a hook that allows you to get the dimensions of the
window. Very much like the React Native hook by the same name.

```tsx
import { useWindowDimensions } from "@jobber/hooks/useWindowDimensions";
```

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <UseWindowDimensions />
</Canvas>
