## Goal

Allow the user to consistently manage settings for their account or for specific
features within the application.

## Use whenâ€¦

Something about the user's account or functionality needs to be managed and it

- can't be done in the context of the main application
- involves setting a default that does not frequently change
- has a group of related options that are better managed in a single place

## Solution

<iframe
  style={{
    border: "var(--border-base) solid var(--color-border)",
    borderRadius: "var(--radius-base)",
    overflow: "hidden",
  }}
  title="Figma overview"
  width="100%"
  height="600"
  src="https://embed.figma.com/design/HXWXusJPZLmaJNGlKEpiyhXW/Product-Base?m=auto&node-id=30406-25&embed-host=share"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>

Under the appropriate section in the Settings menu, add a setting for the
feature.

Most settings can be managed with the `FeatureSwitch` component, which allows:

- turning functionality on and off
- editing aspects of the feature via a `Modal`
- if the page supports it, live updates to the setting

## Implementation

The [FeatureSwitch](../components/FeatureSwitch) component is a good starting
point for most settings. If the setting is more complex, you can trigger a
[Modal](../components/Modal) to edit the setting.

For cases where you don't need the full functionality of the `FeatureSwitch`,
you can compose a layout of the pieces you do need.
