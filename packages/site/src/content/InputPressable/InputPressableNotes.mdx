## Controlled & Uncontrolled

InputPressable can only be used as a controlled component. Given the nature of
this input component which requires a wrapper to set the value, it doesn't make
sense for this component to be uncontrolled.

## Developer notes

To prevent a previously focused input from being focused again when the
`InputPressable` is closed you can `Keyboard.dismiss()` in the `onPress`.
