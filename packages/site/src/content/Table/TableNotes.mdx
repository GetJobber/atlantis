## Configuration

### Cell Types

A `<Cell>` can contain text, or other elements. It can also be used to make
specialized reusable cell types such as `<CellNumeric />` and
`<CellCurrency />`.

### CellNumeric

A `<CellNumeric />` is used to display numeric values to users in tables. It is
preferred to simply `<Cell>` as it ensures characters are visually aligned
vertically.

### CellCurrency

A `<CellCurrency />` is used to format and display monetary values.
