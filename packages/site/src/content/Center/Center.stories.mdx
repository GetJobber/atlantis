# Center

The Center component horizontally centers content within its container. It
provides a simple way to create centered layouts with optional text alignment
and spacing controls.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Center when you need to:

- Create a centered layout with controlled maximum width
- Center content horizontally within a container
- Maintain consistent spacing from container edges
- Center both content and text alignment together

### Related components

- For vertical centering, use [Cover](/components/Cover) with `Cover.Center`

## Content guidelines

The Center component can contain any valid React content, including:

- Text and typography components
- Interactive elements like buttons and forms
- Layout components like Stack or Cluster
- Media elements like images or videos

## Accessibility

The Center component is a layout utility that doesn't affect the accessibility
of its content. However, when using `andText`, ensure that centered text
maintains readability and doesn't impair comprehension for users with reading
difficulties.

## Examples

### Basic centering

<Canvas>
  <Center>
    <Stack>
      <Heading level={1}>Centered content</Heading>
      <Text>This content is horizontally centered</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Center>
</Canvas>

### Centered text with maximum width

<Canvas>
  <Center maxWidth="200px" andText>
    <Stack>
      <Heading level={2}>Narrow content</Heading>
      <Text>This content and text are centered within a 200px container</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Center>
</Canvas>

### With gutters

<Canvas>
  <Center gutters="largest">
    <Stack>
      <Heading level={2}>Spaced content</Heading>
      <Text>This content maintains minimum spacing from container edges</Text>
    </Stack>
  </Center>
</Canvas>

### Intrinsic centering

<Canvas>
  <Center intrinsic>
    <Text>
      This text is rather long to showcase how intristic centering works. If
      elements within the Center component have less width than the longest
      item, they will naturally find the center of the widest item
    </Text>
    <Box padding="base">
      <Button label="Centered Button" />
    </Box>
  </Center>
</Canvas>
