# List

The `List` component renders a collection of items in a structured way. It
supports both [flat lists](#basic-flat-list) and
[sectioned lists](#sectioned-list), and allows for
[custom rendering](#custom-rendering-advanced-usage) of list items via a render
function.

## Design & usage Guidelines

The `List` component is a great solution if you are looking to display a
collection of objects that are either the same type or related to one another,
like billing or activity feed. The main purpose of a list is to help the user
find an object that leads to its full representation.

The majority of list implementations can be achieved without needing to
customize rendering. If your items conform to the `ListItemProps` interface, the
component will render them automatically with the default behavior. A prop of
type `ListItemProps` must be used when using default rendering.

#### Basic Flat List

<Canvas>
  <Card>
    <List
      items={[
        {
          id: 1,
          content: "Content",
          icon: "work",
          iconColor: "interactive",
          title: "Title",
          value: "Value",
          onClick: () => alert("First list item clicked"),
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          content: "Content",
          icon: "work",
          iconColor: "interactive",
          title: "Title",
          value: "Value",
          onClick: () => alert("Second list item clicked"),
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Card>
</Canvas>

#### Sectioned List

If a section field is present in any item, the list will group the items by
their section and display them under section headers. If even one section key
exists in any of items then it will be expected that every object within that
collection will have a section defined.

If a section is missing, "Other" will be used by default, and any items with a
section of "Other" will be grouped with that first occurrence that has no
section. To provide your header value for items missing a section, use the
`defaultSectionHeader` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Card>
    <List
      items={[
        {
          id: 1,
          content: "Content",
          icon: "work",
          iconColor: "interactive",
          title: "Title",
          value: "Value",
          section: "Section 1",
          onClick: () => alert("First list item clicked"),
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          content: "Content",
          icon: "work",
          iconColor: "interactive",
          title: "Title",
          value: "Value",
          section: "Section 1",
          onClick: () => alert("Second list item clicked"),
        },
        {
          id: 3,
          content: "Content",
          icon: "work",
          iconColor: "interactive",
          title: "Title",
          value: "Value",
          section: "Section 2",
          onClick: () => alert("Second list item clicked"),
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Card>
</Canvas>
