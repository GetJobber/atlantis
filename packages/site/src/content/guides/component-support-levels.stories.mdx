# Component support levels

<Banner type="notice" dismissible={false}>
By default, all components in our design system are considered **Supported**. In some cases, we may reclassify a
component as _Legacy_ or _Deprecated_ to better guide teams on how it should be used going forward.
</Banner>

## Supported

The current, recommended way to solve a given design/UX problem.

* Actively maintained and documented.
* Supported by design and engineering teams (bug fixes, enhancements).

## Beta

Components that are still in development and may be subject to significant breaking changes.

* Mostly functional but less stable.
* May be missing important features.
* Considered experimental and may contain new patterns we're exploring.
* Supported by design and engineering teams (bug fixes, enhancements).

## Legacy

Components that still work and are technically supported, but not recommended for new use because a better alternative exists.

* We may address critical issues (e.g., security, accessibility blockers, app-breaking bugs).
* We cannot guarantee fixes for every bug due to the complexity or limited maintainability of this component.
* We’ll provide guidance, workarounds, and migration help when issues come up.

## Deprecated

Components that are not supported.

* Clearly labeled “Deprecated” in documentation.
* No new development, features, or bug fixes.
