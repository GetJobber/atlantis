# Writing documentation

<br />

## Purpose

We should write clear, consistent docs to create a coherent experience for our
consumers.

<br />

## Principles

<br />

### Minimum viable correctness

| **✅ Do**                                                         | **❌ Don't**                                           |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Provide the minimum amount of information necessary to be correct | Attempt to preempt every possible question or use case |

Less is more. The more we write...

- the more consumers must read
- the more we must maintain

We can always write more later as-needed to reflect questions that consumers
bring to the team, or as the system evolves.

<br />

### Document for Jobber

Follow Atlantis content guidelines for written content and component examples:

- [formatting](/content/formatting)
- [voice & tone](/content/voice-and-tone)
- [vocabulary](/content/product-vocabulary)

#### Relevance

| **✅ Do**                              | **❌ Don't**                               |
| :------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Use realistic examples and sample data | Insert your favourite fictional characters |

As tempting as it is to use characters from _insert your favourite
book/movie/show_ into a component example, not everyone consumes the same media
as you and the reference may not be understood.

<br />

### Show show show... then tell

| **✅ Do**                          | **❌ Don't**                         |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| <img src={showDo} width="300px" /> | <img src={showDont} width="300px" /> |

Embed `Stories` inline, share working code snippets, and use clear **✅ Do** /
**❌ Don't** examples to give people what they need with less effort.

<br />

### Use hierarchy

| **✅ Do**                     | **❌ Don't**                   |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Design guidance**           | **Design guidance**            |
| -> When to use                | -> When to use                 |
| -> Related components         | **Callbacks**                  |
| -> Content guidelines         | **Related components**         |
| -> Accessibility              | -> Accessibility               |
| **Implementation guidance**   | **Controlled vs uncontrolled** |
| -> Props                      | **Responsiveness**             |
| -> Callbacks                  | **Component composition**      |
| -> Component composition      | -> Props                       |
| -> Controlled vs uncontrolled |                                |

Clearly distinguish code-specific guidance from conceptual guidance so consumers
can find what they're looking for without feeling overwhelmed.

The template generated by `npm run generate` should be your starting point.

## Component documentation

For each component page, there can be up to four tabs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Design">
    Contains guidance for:
    - When to use the component
    - Design patterns and best practices
    - Content guidelines
    - Accessibility considerations

    Write documentation for this tab in the `docs/components` directory.

  </Tab>

<Tab label="Web">
  Contains a live code editor and props table, specific to web usage.
</Tab>

<Tab label="Mobile">
  Contains a live code editor and props table, specific to mobile usage.
</Tab>

  <Tab label="Implement">
    Contains guidance for:
    - Controlled vs uncontrolled
    - Component composition
    - Platform-specific implementation details
    - Developer notes

    Write documentation for this tab in the `packages/site/src/content` directory.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
