# Atlantis overview

Atlantis is [Jobber’s](https://www.getjobber.com/) design system. It holds the
foundational design tokens shared across our web and mobile platforms, as well
as a library of re-usable React components for the web and mobile, guidance for
patterns and practices for building with them.

Atlantis is maintained by Jobber's
[UX Foundations](https://jobber.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEAMATL) team, but
welcomes [contributions.](/guides/contributing)

## Using Atlantis in your work

You can leverage Atlantis everywhere from ideation to development.

### Shaping

Using Atlantis tokens, components and patterns can help speed up your ideation
and reduce time-to-solution by providing ready-made solutions to common design
problems. This frees you up to focus on more complex design challenges.

### Delivery

Using Atlantis components and design tokens provides a ready-made translation
layer for designers and engineers to speak the same language. Atlantis Figma and
React components use the same property names and values wherever possible to
help teams stay on the same page in delivery.

## Support

For Jobber teams, the UX Foundations team is here to help with weekly office
hours and a dedicated Slack channel for support.

For external consumers and contributors, we have an
[Issues board](https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/issues) on GitHub.

## Design systems resources

These resources are a great place to start learning more about design systems,
seeing how others are building and evolving their systems and practices, or
getting more involved in the design systems community beyond Jobber.
