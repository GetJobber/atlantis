# Atlantis Quick Start

Getting up and running with Atlantis in web or mobile is simple. The same
general steps apply to both platforms, but the details are slightly different
and covered in individual sections below.

In genera, you will need to:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Setup styling via CSS on web or theme provider on mobile.
3. Setup root level providers.
4. Start developing!

## Web

#### Pre-requisite

You should have a React application already scaffolded. We recommend
[Vite](https://vite.dev/) for its simplicity, but any React application will
work.

### Building Atlantis for the web (in detail):

1. Install the web dependencies:

```javascript
    npm install @jobber/components @jobber/design
```

2. Import the styles at the root of your application:

```javascript
// Base tokens
import "@jobber/design/foundation.css";

// Component styles
import "@jobber/components/styles";
```

3. Import the AtlantisContext and AtlantisProvider at the root of your
   application:

```javascript
import {
  AtlantisContext,
  AtlantisThemeContextProvider,
} from "@jobber/components";

// Base tokens
import "@jobber/design/foundation.css";

// Component styles
import "@jobber/components/styles";

function App() {
  return (
    <AtlantisContext
      value={{
        dateFormat: "MM/DD/YYYY",
        timeFormat: "HH:mm",
        timeZone: "America/New_York",
        floatSeparators: { decimal: ".", group: "," },
        currencySymbol: "$",
        locale: "en-US",
        firstDayOfWeek: 0,
      }}
    >
      <AtlantisThemeContextProvider>
        {/* Your app content */}
      </AtlantisThemeContextProvider>
    </AtlantisContext>
  );
}
```

4. Depending on your setup, you may have to instruct Typescript that
   `@jobber/components/styles` is a css file (since it lacks a .css extension).
   You can do that by adding the following to a d.ts file in your project:

```javascript
declare module "@jobber/components/styles" {
}
```

## Mobile

#### Pre-requisite

You should have a React Native application already scaffolded. We recommend
[Expo](https://expo.dev/) for its simplicity, but any React Native application
will work.

### Building Atlantis for react-native (in detail):

1. Install the dependencies:
   `npm install @jobber/components-native @jobber/hooks @jobber/formatters @jobber/design @react-native-clipboard/clipboard @apollo/client @gorhom/bottom-sheet react-native-modal-datetime-picker react-native-reanimated react-native-svg date-fns-tz @apollo/client`
1. You may need to use `--legacy-peer-deps` appended to the command above to
   install the dependencies if you are using a slightly older version of React
   Native.
1. Import the AtlantisContext at the root of your application:

```javascript
import { AtlantisContext } from "@jobber/components";
import {
  AtlantisContext,
  AtlantisThemeContextProvider,
} from "@jobber/components-native";
import { IntlProvider } from "react-intl";
import { GestureHandlerRootView } from "react-native-gesture-handler";
import { Host } from "react-native-portalize";
import { SafeAreaProvider, SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context";

function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider>
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <GestureHandlerRootView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
          <Host>
            <IntlProvider locale="en-US">
              <AtlantisContext
                value={{
                  dateFormat: "MM/DD/YYYY",
                  timeFormat: "HH:mm",
                  timeZone: "America/New_York",
                  isOnline: true,
                  onLogError: () => {},
                  floatSeparators: { decimal: ".", group: "," },
                  currencySymbol: "$",
                  headerHeight: 0,
                  locale: "en-US",
                  setHeaderHeight: () => {},
                }}
              >
                <AtlantisThemeContextProvider>
                  {/* Your app content */}
                </AtlantisThemeContextProvider>
              </AtlantisContext>
            </IntlProvider>
          </Host>
        </GestureHandlerRootView>
      </SafeAreaView>
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```

3. Make sure to rebuild the application to pick up the native modules.
