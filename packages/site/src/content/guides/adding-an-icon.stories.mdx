# Adding an icon

## Design guidelines

#### Size, weight, and spacing

When contributing a new icon, design for the `base` size. The `small` and
`large` sizes will be created automatically once the `base` size has been added.

<Figma url="https://www.figma.com/design/HXWXusJPZLmaJNGlKEpiyhXW/Product%2FBase?m=auto&node-id=22052-110&t=MBdtC5XQjEl6WoD4-1" />

| Specification | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Frame size    | 24x24 |
| Max icon size | 20x20 |
| Safe area     | 2px   |
| Stroke weight | 2px   |

Icons are only responsible for their own 2px safe area. Spacing when used within
other components, such as [List](/components/List), is the responsibility of
those components.

#### Corners

<Figma url="https://www.figma.com/design/HXWXusJPZLmaJNGlKEpiyhXW/Product%2FBase?m=auto&node-id=22052-80&t=MBdtC5XQjEl6WoD4-1" />

| Corner Type      | Radius    |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| 90°              | 2px       |
| More than 90°    | 1px       |
| Less than 90°    | 0.5px     |
| Interior corners | No radius |

#### Line terminals

<Figma url="https://www.figma.com/design/HXWXusJPZLmaJNGlKEpiyhXW/Product%2FBase?m=auto&node-id=22052-63&t=MBdtC5XQjEl6WoD4-1" />

| Line Terminal Type   | Style            |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Interrupted lines    | Geometric/square |
| Organic line endings | Round            |

#### Color

Design your icons with `#000000`. If an icon is associated with a systemic color
such as ["destructive"](../?path=/docs/design-colors--docs#destructive) specify
the system color for the icon when it is added to Atlantis. In all other cases,
use the default icon color.

Get approval for your new icon from the design team, then proceed to creating
and exporting a production-ready SVG from Figma.

## Creating and exporting from Figma

1. With the vector object selected, outline strokes (shift + command + o or
   Object > Outline Stroke in the Figma menu)

- Tip: `CMD + /` will open quick actions.

<img width="100%" src={addIcon1} />

2. Use the Union tool to combine all vector elements into one object

<img width="100%" src={addIcon2} />

3. Flatten the vector object (`command + e` or `Object > Flatten Selection`)

<img width="100%" src={addIcon3} />

4. Rename the vector object "Union" (see icons in Product/Base for reference)

5. Set the vector object to have a fill of `#000000`

6. Open
   [Fill Rule Editor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/771155994770327940/Fill-Rule-Editor)
   from the Plugins by clicking "Run"

<img width="100%" src={addIcon4} />

7. The goal here is to ensure everything is highlighted blue (non-zero rule)
   under the "Fill Rule Editor" instead of orange (even-odd rule)

- Figma uses even-odd rule for SVG's and it isn't widely supported

<img width="100%" src={addIcon5} />

8. Click the orange vectors to turn them blue

<img width="100%" src={addIcon6} />

9. Once it's in a blue state, some hollow parts will be filled again. To make
   them have holes again, click the paths/lines you want to be hollowed.

- Tip: When you hover on the path, it'll get darker. At that point, you can
  click it! Otherwise, it'll turn orange again and you'll have to start over.
  <img width="100%" src={addIcon7} />

10. Export an SVG of your icon in the 24×24 frame. Ensure:
    - your vector object is not going outside of the frame
    - the Frame has the "Clip Content" checkmark unchecked
    - width and height are 24×24

<img width="100%" src={addIcon8} />

## Adding your icon to Atlantis

Either you (the designer) or your devs can do this step. This assumes that you
have the Atlantis repo on your machine and know how to use GitHub.

1. Open the Atlantis folder in your machine and navigate to
   `packages/design/src/icons`. Drop your exported SVG in the icons folder
2. Open a file called `Icon.stories.mdx` and update the Icons documentation
3. Find the appropriate section for your icon (such as Arrows, Files, or User)
   and add it to that list

### To preview locally

1. Open your terminal and run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run bootstrap`
3. Run `npm start`

### To publish a preview build

1. Push your code to GitHub (Atlantis will compress your SVG files on commit)
2. Create a Pull Request (PR)
3. A preview build will be automatically created and appear on your PR as a
   comment

### Reviews and approvals

1. Tag the Atlantis team for a review
2. Once approved, Atlantis will merge your PR

## Using your icon

One the PR is merged, import into your project by running
`npm i @jobber/components@latest @jobber/design@latest` in the repo where you
need to use your icon.

If at any point you run into issues or have questions about this process, please
reach out to us at #team-atlantis

## Troubleshooting

My icon has areas filled in that shouldn't be!
