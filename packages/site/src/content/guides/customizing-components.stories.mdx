# Customizing components

## Balancing simplicity, flexibility, and consistency

Atlantis is designed to make building consistent, accessible, and visually
appealing user interfaces as effortless as possible for you.

We strive to speed up building the most common use cases "out of the box" with
thoughtful defaults that create consistency for users. When unique scenarios
arise that may require customization, we provide flexible mechanisms to extend
or modify our components without compromising the integrity of their most common
use cases.

We recommend using the default implementations wherever possible to benefit
from:

- consistency
- improvements from the design system "for free"
- built-in accessibility

If you choose to customize components, you assume responsibility for these
concerns and any issues that may arise in future versions.

## Compound components

Some components expose their foundational building blocks. This usually includes
subcomponents and hooks for providing styles, state, and additional logic.

These components provide greater flexibility, giving you much more control over
their appearance and behaviour.

### Example: [Button](../components/Button)

The `Button` component offers a very simple API allowing you to specify a label,
icon, and icon position. However, because it doesn't accept children, it's very
inflexible.

```tsx
<Button label="Home" icon="home" iconOnRight />
```

For greater control, `Button` is also available as a compound component and has
exposed `Button.Label` and `Button.Icon` as subcomponents. This allows complete
customization of the button's underlying content.

Using the provided subcomponents, it's possible to build something more complex
like this:

```tsx
function Example() {
  const [created, setCreated] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Button
      onClick={() => setCreated(!created)}
      variation={created ? "destructive" : "work"}
    >
      {created ? <Avatar initials="AB" /> : <Button.Icon name="person" />}
      <Button.Label>{created ? "Delete user" : "Create user"}</Button.Label>
    </Button>
  );
}
```

`Button` also exposes a few hooks that can be used within your own components:

- `useButtonStyles`: Returns a map of css classes that `Button` uses internally.
  Consumers might use this to make something else look like a `Button`.
- `useButtonContext`: Returns internal context that the `Button` shares with its
  subcomponents. Consumers might use Button's context within a custom child
  component, allowing that child to adapt to the `size` prop for example.

## Named `customRender____` props

Some of our components use render props following the `customRender____` naming
convention.

This allows you to both:

- inject your own UI logic
- retain the default behaviors and functionality of the component

[Reference implementation](https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/blob/304e776cf7fc1b9683cecbb1d7a0d8dbebdb60bb/packages/components/src/List/List.tsx#L25C3-L25C60)

### Example: [List](../components/List) customRenderItem

```tsx
const renderProductItem = item => (
  <Flex template={["shrink", "grow"]} align="start">
    <Text>{item.price}</Text>
    <Heading level={4}>{item.name}</Heading>
  </Flex>
);

export const CustomRenderExample = () => (
  <List items={items} customRenderItem={renderProductItem} />
);
```

## Slot props with ReactNode

Extending prop types to allow a `ReactNode` to be inserted is useful for simpler
cases where your:

- customization does not depend on internal state
- design is relatively simple

[Reference implementation](https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/blob/master/packages/components/src/Tabs/Tabs.tsx#L119C3-L119C38)

### Example: [Tab](../components/Tabs) label

```tsx
<Tab label={<MyCustomLabel />} />
```

Customizing the `label` doesn’t require exposing or interacting with the `Tab`’s
internal state (e.g., active state styling).

## UNSAFE\_ props

<Banner type="warning" dismissible={false}>
  These properties are prefixed `UNSAFE_` for a reason! Their usage is **at your
  own risk** and should be considered a **last resort**. Atlantis updates may
  break these usages.
</Banner>

`UNSAFE_` props are used to allow for advanced styling customization of:

- a component's container
- in some cases, a component's sub-components

If you are considering using an `UNSAFE_` prop, we encourage you to
[talk to us](https://getjobber.slack.com/archives/C03BJHV3PMG) to look for safer
ways to meet your needs.

[Reference implementation](https://github.com/GetJobber/atlantis/blob/304e776cf7fc1b9683cecbb1d7a0d8dbebdb60bb/packages/components/src/Popover/Popover.tsx#L36-L56)

### Example: `UNSAFE_className`

```tsx
<Component UNSAFE_className={{ container: styles.customClass }} />

.customClass {
  background-color: var(--color-surface--background);
  padding-right: var(--space-larger);
}
```

```tsx
<Component UNSAFE_className={{ container: "custom-container-class" }} />
```

### Example: `UNSAFE_style`

```tsx
<Component
  UNSAFE_style={{
    container: { backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--background)" },
    dismissArrow: { paddingRight: "var(--space-larger)" },
  }}
/>
```

**Note:** Inspiration for this approach was taken from:

- React Spectrum's
  [UNSAFE\_ escape hatches](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/styling.html#escape-hatches)
- Gestalt's
  [dangerouslySet**\_** pattern](https://gestalt.pinterest.systems/get_started/developers/hacking_gestalt#Box's-dangerouslySetInlineStyle)
