## Configuration

### Custom (Chromium) vs native

Select (V2) is native by default. Opt into the customizable Chrome UI with
`UNSAFE_experimentalStyles`. This enhances grouped menus in Chromium 123+ when
the browser supports `appearance: base-select`.

#### Alignment limitation (custom UI)

When using `UNSAFE_experimentalStyles`, the closed control (what you see as the
displayed value) is still rendered by the browser's picker. As a result,
right/center alignment of the displayed value is not configurable in Chromium's
customizable select.

- Need right/center alignment? Use the native Select (omit
  `UNSAFE_experimentalStyles`).
- You can still style the grouped dropdown (optgroup/option) in the custom UI,
  but the closed value alignment will remain default.

## Component customization

### Composable usage

Select supports composition via subcomponents:

- `Select.Option`: item in the list. Provide `value` and children as the label.
- `Select.OptionGroup`: group options under a `label`. Use with
  `UNSAFE_experimentalStyles` to opt into the customizable grouped menu in
  Chromium.

#### Customization links

- See
  ["A customizable select"](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/a-customizable-select)
  article for what the Chrome UI exposes: `::picker(select)`, option/optgroup
  styling, and transitions.

## UNSAFE\_ props (advanced usage)

General guidance on `UNSAFE_` props can be found in
[Customizing components](/guides/customizing-components).

Select subcomponents allow `UNSAFE_className` and `UNSAFE_style` to target the
native elements:

- `Select.OptionGroup` maps to `<optgroup>`
- `Select.Option` maps to `<option>`

Note that native `<select>` UX differs per browser. Use `UNSAFE_` props with
caution and test across environments. In the custom UI (Chromium), only the
dropdown content is stylable; the closed value alignment is not.
