## Component customization

### UNSAFE\_ props (advanced usage)

General information for using `UNSAFE_` props can be found
[here](/guides/customizing-components).

**Note**: Use of `UNSAFE_` props is **at your own risk** and should be
considered a **last resort**. Future Menu updates may lead to unintended
breakages.

Menu has multiple elements that can be targeted with classes or styles:

- `menu`: The actual menu element containing the actions
- `section`: The container for each section
- `action`: The container for each individual action

#### UNSAFE_className (web)

Use `UNSAFE_className` to apply custom classes to the Menu. This can be useful
for applying styles via CSS Modules.

#### UNSAFE_style (web)

The `UNSAFE_style` prop provides granular control over the Menu's appearance
through inline styles.
