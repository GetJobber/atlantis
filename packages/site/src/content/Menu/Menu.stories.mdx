# Menu

A Menu is made up of 2 primary parts: the trigger, typically a Button, and the
Menu container.

The Menu container is not visible by default, interacting with the trigger will
open the Menu.

The Menu is meant to offer a list of actions for a user to choose from, though
only one may be used at a time. The Menu will close after an action is invoked,
the ESC key is pressed, or a click outside the Menu is registered.

Menu does not have a selected state. The actions are ephemeral with no state
persisting between opens making them well suited for actions such as navigating
to a new page, or launching a Modal.

Menu is navigable by keyboard with arrow keys. Because of this only one action
may occur per row. Nesting additional interactive elements within a single Menu
action prevents keyboard access. When the Trigger is activated by keyboard, we
move focus to the first item in the Menu upon opening.

The other elements of a Menu are optional Sections, Separators and Headers.
These elements are non interactive, nor focusable.

> Keep Menu item content simple. Aim for at most three columns per row: a
> leading icon, a label, and one simple trailing element (e.g., a
> `StatusIndicator`). More complex layouts increase cognitive load and can
> introduce complexity with the Menu's built in alignment features.

### Small screens

When a user is on a small screen device (less than ~500px), the Menu when opened
will display as a tray or bottom-sheet like interface, opening upward from the
bottom of the screen.

It will have all the same elements as the standard version, and an additional
Overlay covering the non-Menu area.

## Content guidelines

Menu action labels should be sentence-cased. This means in general, capitalize
only the first letter of the label unless there is a proper noun (such as a
person's name) in the label.

Jobber features, such as jobs, quotes, and invoices, are not proper nouns and
[should not be capitalized.](/content/product-vocabulary)
