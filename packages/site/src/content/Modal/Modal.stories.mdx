# Modal

Modals are overlays that allow users to view, edit, or show informations that
doesn't require a page to be built. It also prevent users from interacting with
the rest of the application until a specific action is taken.

## Scrolling

When modal content exceeds the available viewport height, the composed
`Modal.Provider` implementation automatically handles scrolling within the modal
itself, whereas the prop based `Modal` will result in scrolling the entire page.

Use [SideDrawer](/components/SideDrawer) if you need to overlay the page's
content and block user interaction with the page, while still maintaining
visibilty of the page's primary contents.

Use [ConfirmationModal](/components/ConfirmationModal) to allow users to confirm
or cancel actions that they are performing.
