## Component customization

### UNSAFE\_ props (advanced usage)

General information for using `UNSAFE_` props can be found
[here](/guides/customizing-components).

SideDrawer has one element that can be targeted with classes or styles: the
container.

**Note**: Use of `UNSAFE_` props is **at your own risk** and should be
considered a **last resort**. Future SideDrawer updates may lead to unintended
breakages.

#### UNSAFE_className

Use `UNSAFE_className` to apply custom classes to the SideDrawer. This can be
useful for applying styles via CSS Modules.

```tsx
// SideDrawer.tsx
  UNSAFE_className={{
    container: styles.customSideDrawerBackground,
  }}

// SideDrawer.module.css
.customSideDrawerBackground {
  background-color: var(--color-surface--background);
}
```

You can also use the `UNSAFE_className` prop to apply custom classes to the
container element within the SideDrawer.

```tsx
  UNSAFE_className={{ container: "custom-container-class" }}
```

#### UNSAFE_style

Use `UNSAFE_style` to apply inline custom styles to the SideDrawer.

```tsx
  UNSAFE_style={{
    container: { backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--background)" },
  }}
```

## Configuration

We're using a compound component pattern to separate the different parts of the
component. This allows us to have a more flexible component.

### Main wrapper

The SideDrawer component is the main component that holds everything.

### Title

The `SideDrawer.Title` component is used to show the title of the SideDrawer.
You can pass a:

- `string` to use the default styling of the title.
- `ReactElement` to customize the title. Keep in mind that you have to handle
  the styling of the title.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Title>My Title</SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```

Or

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Title>
    <Heading level={2} element="h3">
      My Title
    </Heading>
  </SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Actions

The `SideDrawer.Actions` component is used to render the actions next to the
close button. This accepts any component but it is meant to only be for
components that invoke an action.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Actions>
    <Button icon="add" ariaLabel="Add" />
  </SideDrawer.Actions>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Toolbar

The `SideDrawer.Toolbar` component is used to render the toolbar below the title
and have it be sticky. This is great for tools like search and filters that
stick to the top with the title. If your toolbar scrolls with the page, you can
just implement it as a direct child of the `SideDrawer`.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Toolbar>
    <InputText placeholder="Search" />
  </SideDrawer.Toolbar>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Footer

The `SideDrawer.Footer` component is used to render a fixed bar at the bottom of
the SideDrawer. This is great for elements such as buttons that should always be
visible to the user.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Footer>
    <Button label="Save" fullWidth={true} />
  </SideDrawer.Footer>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Back Button

SideDrawer also comes with a back button that you can use and add to the UI
before the title. Use this when the user can navigate back to the previous
SideSheet content.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.BackButton onClick={handleClick} />
  <SideDrawer.Title>My Title</SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```
