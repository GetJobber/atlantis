## Developer notes

The `gap` prop currently accepts both boolean values and semantic spacing
tokens. However, using a boolean is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. The deprecation is communicated through JSDoc comments, which will show
warnings in IDEs and during development. This helps identify and migrate
existing usages, as well as remind developers to use a semantic spacing token
(`small`, `base`, `large`, etc.) when introducing new Grids.

If you find yourself implementing `gap="none"` and the Grid consists only of
Input components, consider using an [InputGroup](/components/InputGroup)
instead.
