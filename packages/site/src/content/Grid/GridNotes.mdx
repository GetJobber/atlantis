## Developer notes

The `gap` prop currently accepts both boolean values and semantic spacing
tokens. However, using a boolean is deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. A console warning is logged when a boolean is passed, which is to help
identify and migrate existing usages, as well as remind developers to use a
semantic spacing token (`small`, `base`, `large`, etc.) when introducing new
Grids.

If you find yourself implementing `gap="none"` and the Grid consists only of
Input components, consider using an [InputGroup](/components/InputGroup)
instead.
