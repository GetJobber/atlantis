## Developer notes

## Testing

When using Jest to test LightBox implementations, you will need to include this
mock in your test setup:

```js
const scrollIntoViewMock = jest.fn();
window.HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView = scrollIntoViewMock;
```

### OnRequestClose

This function receives the index of the last image the user viewed before
closing the LightBox component with the lastPosition key. This might we useful
if we want to return information about the final state when closed (e.g. for
analytics).
