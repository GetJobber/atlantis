## Developer notes

## Testing

When using Jest to test LightBox implementations, you will need to include this
mock in your test setup:

```js
const scrollIntoViewMock = jest.fn();
window.HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView = scrollIntoViewMock;
```

### OnRequestClose

This function receives the index of the last image the user viewed before
closing the LightBox component with the lastPosition key. This might we useful
if we want to return information about the final state when closed (e.g. for
analytics).

### Box Sizing

The lightbox uses the box-sizing property to ensure that the lightbox and its
children are rendered in the correct box-sizing context. This is a solution for
a problem where tailwind was setting the box-sizing to `border-box` and causing
issues with the lightbox.

This is a one off solution for this type of problem. If we were to encounter
this issue again, we should consider a more robust solution.
