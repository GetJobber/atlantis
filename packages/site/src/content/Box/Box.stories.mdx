A box is a generic way to add structure to your page. Stop reaching for CSS
Modules to perform basic page layout, and instead use the Box component.

## Design & usage guidelines

A Box is useful for wrapping content with a specific HTML5 element, and with
common Atlantis specific CSS styles. Box supports standard alignment, border,
borderColor, borderRadius, direction, gap, height, justification, margin,
overflow, padding, position, width and whitespace options.

Use Box if your wrapping CSS styles can be achieved with a prop configuration of
the Box component, to avoid the need for creating a CSS module. Some basic
examples are below, all configuration options are provided in the Basic Web
example via the left-hand navigation.

## Related components

[Card](/components/Card) is a more opionated layout container, with a set
background, border, radius, and an optional preset header. It is the preferred
way to group related information and tasks so that users can consistently scan
and prioritize information more easily.

### No Props

<Canvas>
  <Box>
    This is Box without props. It marks your content as display: flex and
    flex-direction: column
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Base and Padding Base

<Canvas>
  <Box border="base" padding="base">
    By default you get no padding or borders, but with two 'base' props you can
    have both.
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Thick and Padding Large

<Canvas>
  <Box border="thick" padding="large">
    Standard paddings and margins are available, and different borders. This is
    using the 'thick' border along with padding 'large'
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Thickest and Margin Largest and Padding Extravagant

<Canvas>
  <Box margin="largest" border="thickest" padding="extravagant">
    Want a big margin and huge padding? Box has those too.
  </Box>
</Canvas>

## What about actual layout usages?

If you don't really want borders around everything but just want to lay out some
content on the page? You can do that too.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row">
    <Box padding="base" width="grow">
      Left
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" width="grow">
      Right
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Maybe some custom heights or widths?

Box has those as well.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row" alignItems="center">
    <Box padding="base" width={350} border="base">
      Left, 350px wide
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" height={75} border="base">
      Right, 75px high
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### What about a gap between elements?

Standard sizes are supported.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row" alignItems="center" gap="large">
    <Box padding="base" width={50} border="base">
      Left, 50px wide
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" height={25} border="base">
      Right, 25px high
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### I have specific border-left and margin-bottom requirements.

Box supports objects for some of its props, including padding and margin
"bottom, horizontal, left, right, top, vertical"

<Canvas>
  <Box padding={{ top: "large" }} border="thick">
    Top Padding?
  </Box>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Box margin={{ left: "large" }} border="base" padding="base">
    Left Margin?
  </Box>
</Canvas>
