## Developer notes

A key consideration of the Alpha status of this component is whether it should
restrict any non-semantic color usage. It was faster to roll this component with
the full colour set for now.

We will remove the Alpha status when we finalize the decision on the API for
color usage and how we might allow for flexibility while ensuring the component
defaults to respecting theme/modes.
