# Input Password

InputPassword is used to display a secure password input field.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use InputPassword for authentication flows where the user is required to enter a
password.

If you are building an experience for authentication that does not require
character-masking or are looking for more information regarding `validations`,
refer to
[InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext--docs#validation-message).

## Clearable

- **while-editing**: shows the clear button only while focused and when there is
  a value. When focus leaves the field and its controls, the button is hidden.
- **always**: shows the clear button whenever there is a value, even when
  blurred. Never shown when the field is empty.
- The clear button is not shown when the field is `disabled` or `readonly`.
