# Autocomplete (v2)

An Autocomplete component allows a user to quickly pick a preset value from a
larger list of possible options.

## Design & usage guidelines

The options in an Autocomplete component should be a list of possible values
that the user can select. These options should be presented in a way that makes
it easy for the user to find the value they are looking for. There are a few
ways to achieve this.

[Section headings](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-autocomplete-web--section-heading)
can be added to an Autocomplete to break up the options into groups. This can be
useful if there are a lot of options or if the options are related to different
things.

Headers and Footers can be used to present persistent information or actions
that should always be available regardless of results, or scroll location in the
list of options. While there is no limit to how many can be present, it is
advisable to use them sparringly to prevent the options from being the primary
focus of the Autocomplete.

Empty actions can be used to present a user with relevant actions to take when
no options exist.

The "free form" allows for using a text value that does not already exist in the
list of options. This works best when the content of an option is simply a word.
When the content is more complex, we have to consider what to populate the
additional fields with.

An alternate approach when the data is complex is to leverage the empty actions,
actions, or header/footer actions to launch a creation flow to populate the
fields.

Actions can be individually configured to keep the menu open when used if
desired.

Content in options, actions, headers, footers, and sections can all be
customized, however it is imperative to avoid putting additional interactive
elements inside any of these. Because focus remains in the input, and we
"virtually" move the highlighted item with arrow keys on keyboard navigation, it
is impossible to Tab to any nested interactive elements such as a button inside
of a row. Instead, use the provided action interfaces.

When providing complex content in each option, it is recommended to separate the
options with a border bottom to improve readability of the options.

Items of the same type should appear consistently ie. if an Autocomplete has
options, sections and actions avoid making the apperance of some options
different from the rest.

## Related components

- If you want to present a list of predefined options without text input, or the
  number of options is smaller, use a [Select](/components/Select)
- If autocompleted results are not required for the text input, use
  [InputText](/components/InputText)
- If a text input appearance is not required, and options can only be from a
  predefined set then a Combobox can be used
