## Configuration

### Custom activator

If you want to use a different activator to display the DatePicker you can pass
a `React` component as the `activator`. See
[Custom Activator](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--custom-activator)
example.

### Restricting date ranges

If you want to enable for selection only a range of dates you can pass `minDate`
or `maxDate` to the component as props. See
[Date Range](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--min-date-max-date)
example.

### Highlighted dates

If you need to call attention to a series of dates on the calendar, the
`highlightDates` prop accepts an array of dates that will be displayed with
additional emphasis. See the
[Highlighted Dates](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--restricted-date-range)
example.

### Week start

The DatePicker will use the `firstDayOfWeek` value defined either in its props
or from the
[AtlantisContext](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/AtlantisContext). If
both are provided, the value passed directly to the DatePicker takes precedence
over the context.

This value should be a number between 0 and 6, where 0 is Sunday and 6 is
Saturday.

## Developer notes

As mentioned above, the Datepicker wraps
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/).
