## Configuration

### Custom activator

If you want to use a different activator to display the `DatePicker` you can
pass a `React` component as the `activator`. See
[Custom Activator](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--custom-activator)
example.

### Restricting date ranges

If you want to enable for selection only a range of dates you can pass `minDate`
or `maxDate` to the component as props. See
[Date Range](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--min-date-max-date)
example.

### Highlighted dates

If you need to call attention to a series of dates on the calendar, the
`highlightDates` prop accepts an array of dates that will be displayed with
additional emphasis. See the
[Highlighted Dates](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--restricted-date-range)
example.

## Developer Notes

As mentioned above, the Datepicker wraps
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/).
