## Controlled & Uncontrolled

### Controlled component

Web's
[Controlled](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-web--controlled)
version includes a type-ahead feature where typing at least 1 number
automatically fills in the rest of the time. For example, typing `2` will fill
in `2:00 PM` and typing `1` waits for a few milliseconds in case the user wants
to type `10`, `11`, or `12`.
