## Component customization

### UNSAFE\_ props (advanced usage)

General information for using `UNSAFE_` props can be found
[here](/guides/customizing-components).

**Note**: Use of `UNSAFE_` props is **at your own risk** and should be
considered a **last resort**. Future Typography updates may lead to unintended
breakages.

#### UNSAFE_className (web)

Use `UNSAFE_className` to apply custom classes to the Typography component. This
can be useful for applying styles via CSS Modules.

```tsx
// Typography.tsx
<Typography
  UNSAFE_className={{
    textStyle: styles.customText,
  }}
>
  Text with UNSAFE className
</Typography>

// Typography.module.css
.customText {
  color: var(--color-purple);
}
```

#### UNSAFE_style (web & mobile)

Use `UNSAFE_style` to apply inline custom styles to the Typography component.

```tsx
<Typography
  UNSAFE_style={{
    textStyle: {
      color: "var(--color-purple)",
    },
  }}
>
  Text with UNSAFE style
</Typography>
```

## Platform considerations

React Native has a lot of limitations around Android and iOS when it comes to
copying text on a device.

#### Android

- ✅ Highlight specific text
- ✅ Have an option to copy and other smart actions like opening a map when it's
  an address
- ❌ It can't highlight the text on anything that is tappable. For example
  - Button
  - List
  - Long press to copy phone, address, etc
  - In short, anything text you can tap and it does an action like open a modal
    cannot be highlighted

#### iOS

- ❌ Highlight specific text
  - ✅ It can only copy all of the block of text
- ➖ Only have an option to "copy"
- ✅ Unlike Android, It can copy the text on anything that is tappable
  - The long press would show a copy action and cancel the press action on it
