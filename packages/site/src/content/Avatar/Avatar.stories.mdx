# Avatar

An Avatar is used to display a visual identifier for an individual user.

## Design & usage guidelines

Avatars are available in 3 sizes:

- `base`: Used by default
- `large`: Use when the Avatar is the focal point
- `small`: Use on higher-density/compact pages or components

### Color

Use `color` to indicate the background and the border color of an Avatar
component.

When using `color`, make sure that the color is consistent for a user throughout
the application. The color that is represented for an Avatar should be the same
color that represents a user in other parts of the application, such as the
calendar.

### With Tooltip

If an Avatar is displayed without a full name label, display a tooltip.

## Accessibility

Initials and background color should have sufficient color contrast to meet AA
conformance.
