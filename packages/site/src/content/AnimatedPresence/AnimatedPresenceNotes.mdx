import { Banner } from "@jobber/components/Banner";

## Configuration

### Conditional rendering

Hide and show elements with a transition to add emphasis on the change. This is
useful for UX which has a different part of the UI hidden until the user takes
an action to show them.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>{show && <div>Item</div>}</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the
[Basic](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--basic)
example for a live demo.

<Banner type="warning" dismissible={false}>
When using AnimatedPresence with conditional rendering, elements will of course be added
and removed from the DOM causing shifts in the layout, with the potential for frames where neither the entering nor exiting element is yet present.

This can create undesirable visual jumps in some scenarios, such as when the
element's height is what creates enough vertical space to require scrolling. The
layout will have to be stabilized with something such as a min-height to avoid
this.

</Banner>

### List rendering

Animate items in a list as they are added or removed.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>
  {items.map(item => (
    <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
  ))}
</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the [List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list)
example for a live demo.

### Animate on mount

Set the `initial` prop to `true` to animate the element whenever it initially
renders on the screen. See this in action on the
[List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list) example.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence initial={true}>...</AnimatedPresence>
```
