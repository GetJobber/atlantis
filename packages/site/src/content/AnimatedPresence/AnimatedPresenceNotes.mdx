## Configuration

### Timing

The default timing value for the animation is "timing-base"; however if you wish
to speed it up or slow it down all valid timing token values are accepted via
the `timing` prop.

### Exit Behavior

#### Overlay

Elements animate in and out as they are added or removed.

Note that this can cause visible and possibly undesirable shifts in the layout
eg. double height because both elements will be present as one animates out and
the other animates in.

#### Replace

The exiting element is immediately removed, allowing sibling elements to occupy
the new layout.

#### Sequential

One component is rendered at a time. The entering component will wait for the
exiting component to animate out.

### Conditional rendering

Hide and show elements with a transition to add emphasis on the change. This is
useful for UX which has a different part of the UI hidden until the user takes
an action to show them.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>{show && <div>Item</div>}</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the
[Basic](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--basic)
example for a live demo.

### List rendering

Animate items in a list as they are added or removed.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>
  {items.map(item => (
    <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
  ))}
</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the [List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list)
example for a live demo.

### Animate on mount

Set the `initial` prop to `true` to animate the element whenever it initially
renders on the screen. See this in action on the
[List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list) example.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence initial={true}>...</AnimatedPresence>
```
