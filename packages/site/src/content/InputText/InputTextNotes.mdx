## Configuration

### react-hook-form

Atlantis utilizes [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle
`input` and `form` validation. This means that the
[React Hook Form validation options](https://react-hook-form.com/api#register)
are available out of the box.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- `required` - A Boolean which, if true, indicates that the input must have a
  value.
- `maxLength` - The maximum length of the value to accept for this input.
- `minLength` - The minimum length of the value to accept for this input.
- `pattern` - The regex pattern for the input.
- `validate` - You can pass a callback function as the argument to validate, or
  you can pass an object of callback functions to validate all of them.

### Using onValidation (Web)

If you need to capture the error message and render it outside of the component.
Read the [InputValidation](/components/InputValidation) documentation.

### Version 2 Shim (Experimental)

If you need to use the version 2 shim, you can pass `version={2}` to the
`InputText` and provide the required props. Due to issues with typescript
[see](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32447) the aria attributes
(and other props separated by `-`) are not typed correctly. This means that the
shim will not enforce the version to be set to `2` when using these props. As a
result version 1 usages will have these props appear in the intellisense but
they will not do anything.
