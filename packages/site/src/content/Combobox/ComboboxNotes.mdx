## Configuration

Combobox is composed of three main parts: Activator, Content, and Action.

### Activator

The activator is the user-facing interface to open and close the Combobox and
initiate option selection.

#### Default activator

To use the default activator simply omit any kind of `Combobox.Activator`
subcomponent in your instance.

Examples of using a default activator can be found in the
[single-select](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--single-select)
and
[multi-select](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--multi-select)
stories. The label of the default activator can be customized by adding the
optional `label` prop to Combobox, to better reflect the type of data being
selected. Otherwise, the default activator label will read "Select".

The optional `label` prop on Combobox is only effective when using the default
activator.

#### Custom activator

The custom activator should be used in any instance where the default activator
is not suitable.

**Child React Component:** To use a customized `Chip` or `Button` your custom
activator should be a child of `<Combobox.Activator />`. An example of using a
custom activator can be found in the
[custom activator](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--custom-activator)
story.

**Child Render Function:** If neither a Chip nor a Button is sufficient for your
needs, you may instead provide a function as the child to `Combobox.Activator`.

As arguments, the function will receive a method to open the Combobox (closing
is handled internally), and accessibility attributes required for a Combobox.
**You must implement these yourself**. See the
[render function example](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--custom-activator)
for reference.

The render function must return a single, valid JSX Element (it can of course
have children, it simply must have a single wrapping tag). Ensure that tabindex,
focus, and keyboard interactivity are considered and handled appropriately if a
non traditionally interactive element such as a div is used.

### Content

The content of the Combobox is responsible for displaying the list of selectable
options, handling user interactions, and managing search functionality.

`<Combobox.Option />` represents an individual option within the list. Each
option has `id`, `label`, and `prefix` props which are used to identify and
display the option.

#### Custom content

You can use the `prefix` option to render content on the left side of the
provided `label`. An example of this behaviour can be found in the
[Prefix Options](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--prefix-options)
story.

If you need more advanced control of the children inside each option, you can
use the `customRender` prop to supply your own content. Check out the
[Custom Render Options](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--custom-render-options)
story for an example.

### Action

Actions are an optional way to allow users to perform custom tasks such as
adding a new item to the list of options.

By default, when an action is clicked, the Combobox will close. If you want the
Combobox to remain open after an action is clicked, you can use the
`keepOpenOnClick` prop. An example of this behaviour can be found in the
[Keep Open on Click](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--keep-open-on-action-click)
story.

### Selection behavior

#### Single-select

Single-select is Combobox's default selection mode. When a selection is made,
the Combobox will close.

#### Multi-select

Add the `multiSelect` prop to allow multiple options to be selected and/or
un-selected. In multi-select mode, the Combobox will only close when a user
takes an explicit action to close it such as clicking outside the Combobox or
pressing the ESC key.

With multiSelect activated, a header appears beneath the search input, providing
information about the number of selected items. Additionally, a button allows
users to either select or deselect all options in the list.

In the case of selecting all options in a filtered state, only the currently
visible filtered options will be selected. When deselecting all options, every
item will be deselected, irrespective of the filter state.

### Selection callback

As selections are made, the data will be returned via an argument to the
function provided to the `onSelect` prop.

Please note that regardless of if it is a single-select or a multi-select, the
`onSelect` will be called immediately as options are selected (or un-selected in
the case of multi-select). Multi-select will receive an array of all selections,
not only the most recent.

### onClose

If it is desirable to wait until the Combobox has been closed, likely indicating
that all selections have been made, it is recommended to use the optional
`onClose` callback which will fire when the Combobox is closed by any means.
This callback provides no arguments.

While the selections will still be updated in real time, this callback will
allow you to call any potentially expensive operations only once the Combobox
has been closed. As such, it will only have a difference in timing for
multi-select since a single-select selection will immediately close the
Combobox.

### Selection display

When using the default activator, the selections will be displayed inside the
activator. The data will still be returned via callback.

When using a custom activator, the selections will only be returned as data
keeping the choice of how to display the data flexible.

### Custom onSearch

The `onSearch` prop allows you to hook into the Combobox's search input and
receive what the user has typed. This callback is debounced by 300ms by default
but can be configured with the `onSearchDebounce` prop.

When using this callback, we no longer filter the options as a user types.
Everything is left up to the `onSearch` callback and accompanying code to
implement.

An example use case here would be using the search term to fire off a request to
fetch the appropriate data for that term. It is recommended to use the `loading`
prop while fetching & filtering the new data. The loading state will display a
static amount of `Glimmer` components. Then updating `loading` once the new data
has been fetched and the `Combobox.Option`s have been replaced with the new
ones.

Note that the component does not cache the initial options when using
`onSearch`. If new data was fetched and replaced the initial options on search
then a user clears the search, either with the clear button or deleting the
term, the initial options would need to be restored manually.

## Testing

When using Jest to test Combobox implementations, you will need to include this
mock in your test setup:

```js
const scrollIntoViewMock = jest.fn();
window.HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView = scrollIntoViewMock;
```

## Developer notes

- The Combobox confines tabbing to within itself while it's open using
  [useFocusTrap](/hooks/useFocusTrap)
- Pressing `esc` will close the Combobox and return focus to the activator using
  [useRefocusOnActivator](/hooks/useRefocusOnActivator)
