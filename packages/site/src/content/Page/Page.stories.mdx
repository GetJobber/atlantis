# Page

<Meta title="Components/Layouts and Structure/Page" component={Page} />

Use Page to build the outermost "main content" container of a view. Page comes
complete with the ability to add the page title, along with actions, subtitle,
and a description as needed.

## Design & usage guidelines

Using Page is pretty straightforward - after any navigational elements, Page
should contain the content the user will be engaging with. If there is any sort
of footer, it should exist after Page.

### Title

The `title` prop supports both raw strings as well as any react node. This
allows complete flexibility, but with that comes responsibility around best
practices. A page should always start with an H1-level heading for
accessibility.

If you supply a string, the title will automatically be rendered as an H1
heading.

If you supply a custom element, you should include an H1-level heading within
it. Internally we use our [`<Heading level={1}>`](/components/Heading) component
when a string is supplied, so we recommend you use that if possible.

### Widths

#### Narrow

Use a `narrow` Page when the content is optimized for a single column, such as a
form design.

#### Standard

Use a `standard` Page for most "show" state layouts, as it allows for a mix of
contents in a multi-column layout while keeping things constrained so the user
does not have to track too far left-to-right as they interact.

#### Fill

A `fill` Page should be used when the content is optimized for wider views, such
as responsive dashboards and data visualizations, data tables, calendars, or
otherwise does not benefit from horizontal constraints.
