# Input Email

InputEmail is used to display input with built-in email validation.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use the InputEmail component when you expect the user to input an email address.
By default, the InputEmail component will validate email addresses.

If you want to add additional validation within the Web/JO, you can pass in the
`validations` prop with your own message. Note: The validations prop is not
available on mobile.

## Clearable

- **while-editing**: shows the clear button only while focused and when there is
  a value. When focus leaves the field and its controls, the button is hidden.
- **always**: shows the clear button whenever there is a value, even when
  blurred. Never shown when the field is empty.
- The clear button is not shown when the field is `disabled` or `readonly`, and
  is not supported for `multiline` inputs.
