## Developer Notes

We discussed the possibility of sharing arrow key navigation logic between the
SegmentedControl and Combobox components due to their similarities. However, the
SegmentedControl does not have specific arrow key logic because arrow key
navigation is implicitly set through the SegmentedControl radio button
structure. The options are a type of `radio` and part of a group (`name`
attribute) which inherently supports keyboard navigation.

There is another instance where similar logic is used within the
`useInternalChipDismissible` hook. In the future, we will want to consider
refactoring this logic into a shared hook or utility function to reduce
duplication and improve maintainability.
