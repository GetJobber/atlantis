## Component customization

### Custom rendering

If you need more control over the rendering of content in the menu, you can
provide a **custom render function** using `customRenderMenu`

This is useful if the default rendering of the Autocomplete Menu doesn’t meet
your requirements. If a custom render function is provided you will be able to
completely control how the menu is rendered.

This is achieved by providing a function to the `customRenderMenu` prop. This
function will receive the following props:

- `MenuWrapper` is the wrapper of the Autocomplete Menu, this is the element
  that will be visible when the menu is open. It handles the positioning of the
  Autocomplete Menu
- `inputFocused` is a boolean that indicates if the input is focused.
- `onOptionSelect` is a function that is called when an option is selected for
  updating the value of the Autocomplete.
- `options` is the list of options to render in the Autocomplete Menu. This is
  the options that are returned from the `getOptions` function.
- `selectedOption` is the option that is currently selected.
- `menuRef` is a ref that is passed to the Autocomplete Menu this is used by the
  `useKeyboardNavigation` hook to handle the keyboard navigation of the options.
- `inputRef` is a ref that is passed to the Autocomplete Menu to provide a ref
  to the `InputText` component.

There are also some helper functions that are used to handle the keyboard
navigation of the options and the base styling of the options.

- `useKeyboardNavigation` is used to handle the default keyboard navigation of
  the options. Use this hook if you are using only using MenuOption or
  BaseMenuOption components in the menu.
- `useCustomKeyboardNavigation` is used to handle the keyboard navigation of the
  options. Use this hook if you are using components in the menu that aren't
  MenuOption or BaseMenuOption such as custom elements. See the Advanced
  examples below for more information.
- `MenuOption` is the default rendering of the options in the Autocomplete Menu.
  The `UNSAFE_style` prop is used to add a custom styling to the options.
- `isOptionGroup` is a helper function that is used to determine if the option
  is a group.
- `isOptionSelected` is a helper function that is used to determine if the
  option is selected.
- `MenuOptionContent` is the default rendering of the content of the options in
  the Autocomplete Menu.
- `BaseMenuOption` is the base component for the options in the Autocomplete
  Menu. This component provides the base styling and functionality for the
  options such as the separators and the highlighting. This is used in the
  advanced example below.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Basic Override">
In this example we will override the default rendering of the Autocomplete Menu to add a custom styling to the options while keeping the default keyboard navigation.

  <BasicCustomTemplate />

</Tab>
<Tab label="Advanced Menu Override">

In this example we will override the rendering of the menu to render the Options
in a completely custom way. This example will also include a footer that is
rendered at the bottom of the menu with sticky positioning.

**Note:** Due to the complexity of the example, we will not be using the
`useKeyboardNavigation` hook to handle the keyboard navigation of the options.

Instead we will be handling the keyboard navigation manually with the
`useCustomKeyboardNavigation` hook. This requires us to manually keep track of
the highlighted option index and update it when the user navigates the menu.

#### Rendering the Menu Content

The content in the Menu is wrapped by the `<MenuWrapper>` component which
handles attaching the menu to the input. Our custom options are wrapped by the
`BaseMenuOption` component which handles the base styling and functionality for
the options. Inside the `BaseMenuOption` component the content that we want to
render is provided as children.

**Note:** For the footer to be sticky at the bottom of the menu without being
scrollable, the footer needs to be wrapped in a `div` with `position: "sticky"`
and `bottom: 0`.

#### Keyboard Navigation

The following code is the keyboard navigation logic for the menu. It is used to
handle the keyboard navigation of the options and the footer.

- `highlightedOptionIndex` is the index of the option that is currently
  highlighted. It is initially set to -1 to account for the footer being the
  first option when options are being initialized.
- `maxIndex` is the index of the footer.
- `footerFocused` is a boolean that indicates if the footer is focused. We need
  to track this because it can be focused instead of just the Input and if we
  don't then it is possible for the Menu to remain opened
- `menuVisible` is a boolean that indicates if the menu is visible.
- `onRequestHighlightChange` is a function that is called when the user
  navigates the menu.
- `getRequestedIndexChange` is a helper function that is used to get the index
  change based on the keyboard event, direction and if the option is a group.
- `KeyboardAction.Next` case should calculate the exact scroll position needed
  with the footer height offset in mind, when the next element is hidden behind
  the footer.

</Tab>
<Tab label="Advanced Custom Section Headings">

In this example we will override the rendering of the menu to render the an
Autocomplete with Section Headings and Custom Elements in the Section Headings.

**Note:** Similar to the Advanced Custom Menu Override, due to the complexity of
the example, we will not be using the `useKeyboardNavigation` hook to handle the
keyboard navigation of the options.

#### Rendering the Menu Content

The content in the Menu is wrapped by the `<MenuWrapper>` component which
handles attaching the menu to the input. We use the `optionsWithExtraElements`
to render the options. The `optionsWithExtraElements` is the options with the
extra elements inserted in the correct positions. This array is generated using
a custom hook called `useCustomSectionOptions`. (explanation of the hook below).

#### Utilities used for Custom Rendering

The following utilities were created in this example to help with custom
rendering:

`useCustomSectionOptions` determines the indices of the options that should have
extra elements inserted after them. It then inserts the extra elements into an
array and returns it with the extra elements inserted. This is used when the
options are being rendered.

`isExtraElement` is a helper function that is used to determine if the option is
an extra element.

<Disclosure title="isExtraElement (Click to Reveal Code)">

<Source type="code" code={isExtraElementCode} />

</Disclosure>

`SelectableOption` is a component that is used to render the selectable options
in the menu.

#### Keyboard Navigation

The following code is the keyboard navigation logic for the menu. It is used to
handle the keyboard navigation of the options and the footers in each of the
sections.

The keyboard navigation logic is similar to the Advanced Custom Menu Override.
However, we need to account for the extra elements in each of the sections
instead of just a single footer.

`useCustomSectionOptions` returns the options with the extra elements inserted
and the `extraElementFocused` state. It provides event listeners for keeping
track of the focused state for if an extra element is focused. There are
additional checks to see if the requested index is an extra element and if it
is, focus the extra element and if not it will focus the input.
