### Implementation notes (v2)

- **Free-form**: With allowFreeForm, Enter on a closed menu or Blur can commit
  inputValue via createFreeFormValue.
- **Enter**: When the menu is open and an item is active, Enter selects it.
  Otherwise, it only commits in free-form mode.
- **Sections & actions**: Sections render only when they have visible options
  after filtering. Actions can keep the menu open with shouldClose=false.
- **Highlighting**: Opening highlights the selected option; typing clears
  highlight; deleting with a selection can re-highlight it.
