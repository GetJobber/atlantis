# SideKick

The SideKick component provides a complementary panel that appears alongside the
main content area, offering additional context or functionality without
disrupting the primary workflow.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use SideKick when you need to:

- Display supplementary information related to the main content
- Provide quick access to contextual actions or tools
- Show preview content while maintaining focus on the primary task
- Present form fields or options that are optional or secondary to the main
  workflow

### When to use

- When users need quick access to related information without leaving their
  current context
- For displaying preview content that enhances the primary workflow
- When additional options or tools should be readily available but not prominent
- To show supplementary form fields that aren't required for the primary task

### When not to use

- For critical primary actions or required form fields
- When the additional content is essential to complete the main task
- If the supplementary content needs to block interaction with the main content
- For temporary or dismissible notifications (use [Toast](/components/Toast)
  instead)
- For error messages or warnings (use [Banner](/components/Banner) instead)

## Implementation

The SideKick component creates a flexible horizontal layout with a main content
area and a side panel. The layout automatically adjusts based on available space
and wraps content when needed.

### Basic usage

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ width: "100%" }}>
    <SideKick sideWidth="30px" contentMinWidth="30px">
      <Rectangle padding="0">
        <Card>
          <Content>Main content goes here</Content>
        </Card>
      </Rectangle>
      <Rectangle padding="0">
        <Card>
          <Content>Side panel content goes here</Content>
        </Card>
      </Rectangle>
    </SideKick>
  </div>
</Canvas>

### With custom widths

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ width: "100%" }}>
    <SideKick contentMinWidth="30ch" sideWidth="30ch">
      <Rectangle padding="0">
        <Card>
          <Content>Fixed-width side panel (400px)</Content>
        </Card>
      </Rectangle>
      <Rectangle padding="0">
        <Card>
          <Content>Main content (minimum 60% width)</Content>
        </Card>
      </Rectangle>
    </SideKick>
  </div>
</Canvas>
