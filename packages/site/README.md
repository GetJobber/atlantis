# This is the alpha project for the new Atlantis documentation website.

This code is not currently part of any rendering path.

We're using this space to hash out ideas for how we'd like the new documentation
site to operate. Once we've solved any and all issues, we'll roll over to using
this site.

Initially we were also going to split Storybook at the same time, but in order
to move with more speed we'll link to our existing V7 version of storybook for
now, while we slowly migrate in another upcoming project to V8.
