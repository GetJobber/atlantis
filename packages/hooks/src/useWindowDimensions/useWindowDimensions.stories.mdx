# useWindowDimensions

`useWindowDimensions` is a hook that allows you to get the dimensions of the
window. Very much like the React Native hook by the same name.

```tsx
import { useWindowDimensions } from "@jobber/hooks/useWindowDimensions";
```

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story name="useWindowDimensions">
    {() => {
      const { width } = useWindowDimensions();

      useEffect(() => {
        console.log({ width })
      }, [width])
    }}

  </Story>
</Canvas>
