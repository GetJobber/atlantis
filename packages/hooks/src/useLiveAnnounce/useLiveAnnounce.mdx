# useLiveAnnounce

Announce a message through the screen reader whenever a user does an action like
deletion or addition.

```ts
import { useLiveAnnounce } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

Before you try this example, turn on Voice Over (Mac), or a windows equivalent.
You can turn on Voice over by holding `Command âŒ˜` and press the finger print key
3 times (fast).

          label="Delete"
          onClick={() => liveAnnounce("You have clicked the Delete button")}
        />{" "}
        <Button
          label="Add"
