# useBreakpoints

```ts
import { useBreakpoints } from "@jobber/hooks/useBreakpoints";
```

`useBreakpoints` is the JS version of our
[Design/Breakpoints](http://localhost:6005/?path=/docs/design-breakpoints--page)
that uses `window.matchMedia` to mimic the CSS media queries.

This allows you to use the same breakpoints in JS as you do in CSS. It also
returns a `smallOnly`, `mediumOnly`, and `largeOnly` boolean that you can use to
target specific breakpoints since JS doesn't cascade like CSS.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="useBreakpoints">
    {() => {
      const breakpoints = hooks.useBreakpoints();
      const data = Object.entries(breakpoints).map(([key, value], i) => [
        <code key={i}>{key}</code>,
        <InlineLabel key={key} color={value ? "green" : "red"}>
          {String(value)}
        </InlineLabel>,
      ]);
