# useAssert

Disrupt the render of a component when a conditional is not met. This is helpful
when you want to limit something that typescript can't do.

```tsx
import { useAssert } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [shouldAssert, setShouldAssert] = useState(false);
    useAssert(shouldAssert, "This is an error message");
    return (
      <Button label="Trigger error" onClick={() => setShouldAssert(true)} />
    );
  }}
</Playground>

### Return a warning

If you still want to assert but doesn't want to disrupt the rendering, you can
pass in a `warn: true` param. This will throw a warning on your browser console.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [shouldAssert, setShouldAssert] = useState(false);
    useAssert(shouldAssert, "This is an console warning message", {
      warn: true,
    });
    return (
      <Button
        label="Trigger console warning"
        onClick={() => setShouldAssert(true)}
      />
    );
  }}
</Playground>
