# useAssert

During development, disrupt the render of a component when a conditional is met.
This is helpful when you want to limit something that typescript can't do.

```tsx
import { useAssert } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

```tsx
const child: ReactElement = <Avatar initials="JBR" />;
// Make sure the child can only be an <Icon /> component
useAssert(child.type !== Icon, "You can only pass in an <Icon /> child");
```

### Return a warning

If you still want to assert but doesn't want to disrupt the rendering, you can
pass in a `warn: true` param. This will throw a warning on your browser console.

```tsx
const url: string = "http://getjobber.com";
// Make sure the url always starts with https://
useAssert(url.startsWith("http://"), "Please pass in an `https://` url", {
  warn: true,
});
```
