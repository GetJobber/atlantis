# useAssert

```tsx
import { useAssert } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

## Error

During development, disrupt the render of a component when a conditional is met.
This is helpful when you want to limit something that typescript can't do...
yet.

<!-- TODO: Test if this is the one that makes the deploy preview fail -->

<!-- ```
const child: ReactElement = <Avatar initials="JBR" />;
// Make sure the child can only be an <Icon /> component
useAssert(child.type !== Icon, "You can only pass in an <Icon /> child");
``` -->

## Warn

If you still want to assert but doesn't want to disrupt the render, you can pass
in a `warn: true` param. This will throw a warning on your browser console.

<!-- ```
const url: string = "http://getjobber.com";
// Make sure the url always starts with https://
useAssert(
  !url.startsWith("https://"),
  "Please pass in a URL that starts with `https://` url",
  { warn: true },
);
``` -->
