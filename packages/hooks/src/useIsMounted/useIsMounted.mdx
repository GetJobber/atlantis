# UseIsMounted

`useIsMounted` is a generalized hook that upon initial loading triggers a
`useLayoutEffect` that sets the isMounted to true right after the component is
mounted. When the component unmounts, it calls the cleanup function that sets
`isMounted` to false. This `useLayoutEffect` hook will only be run once.

```tsx
import { useIsMounted } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    return (
      <Button
        label={"Mount Component"}
        onClick={() => {
          alert("this will mount something");
        }}
      />
    );
  }}
</Playground>
