# Progress Bar

A progress bar geared towards completed and in progress tasks. The
`amountFormatted` and `totalAmountFormatted` total worth are presented to show
the value of the completed tasks.

```ts
import { ProgressBar } from "atlantis/ProgressBar";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="default"
    args={{
      total: 5,
      current: 1,
      inProgress: 2,
      loading: false,
      amountFormatted: "$10",
      totalAmountFormatted: "$100",
      reverseTheme: true,
    }}
  >
    {args => <ProgressBar {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={ProgressBar} />

## Usage Guidelines

`ProgressBar` should be used to show "definite" progress; we know exactly how
close the process is to completion. For "indefinite" progress, where we may not
know exactly how much longer something might take, use `ActivityIndicator`.

Use cases for `ProgressBar` include:

- Account setup, to show state of completion in a step-by-step progression
- File uploading, to show the status of completion for a file
