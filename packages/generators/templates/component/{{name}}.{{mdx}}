## Design & Usage Guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the {{ name }} component, consider the following:

- When using the {{ name }} component always consider the volume you would like it to
  be displayed at.
- The {{ name }} component should never be used inside another component.

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.

## Loud

Use `loud` to indicate that a component is yelling.

<Playground>
  <{{ name }} text="Fred" loud={true} />
</Playground>
