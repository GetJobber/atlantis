Tables are used to organize and display tabular data to users.

In addition to the base `Table` component there are additionally `Header`,
`Footer`, `Row` and `Cell` each of which are used to construct a compliant
table.

Multiple [Cell types](#cell-types) are provided for common formats.

## Simple Example

<Playground>
  <Table>
    <Header>
      <Cell>Ship</Cell>
      <Cell>Class</Cell>
      <Cell>Cost</Cell>
      <Cell>Crew</Cell>
    </Header>
    <Row>
      <Cell>Nostromo</Cell>
      <Cell>Towing Vehicle</Cell>
      <CellCurrency value={42000000} />
      <CellNumeric value={7} />
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Cell>Rodger Young</Cell>
      <Cell>Corvette Transport</Cell>
      <Cell />
      <CellNumeric value={200} />
    </Row>
    <Row>
      <Cell>USS Enterprise</Cell>
      <Cell>Constitution</Cell>
      <Cell />
      <CellNumeric value={205} />
    </Row>
    <Footer>
      <Cell />
      <Cell />
      <Cell />
      <CellNumeric value={412} />
    </Footer>
  </Table>
</Playground>

## Properties

Most table components do not currently accept options.

## Cell Types

### Cell

A `Cell` can contain text, or other elements. It can also be used to make
specialized reusable cell types such as `CellNumeric` and `CellCurrency`.

<Props of={Cell} />

### CellNumeric

A `CellNumeric` is used to display numeric values to users in tables. It is
preferred to simply `Cell` as it ensures characters are visually aligned
vertically.

<Props of={CellNumeric} />

### CellCurrency

A `CellCurrency` is used to format and display monetary values.

<Props of={CellCurrency} />
