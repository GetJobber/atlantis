# Table

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="yes" />

Tables are used to organize and display tabular data to users.

In addition to the base `Table` component there are additionally `Header`,
`Body`, `Footer`, `Row` and `Cell` each of which are used to construct a
compliant table.

Multiple [Cell types](#cell-types) are provided for common formats.

```ts
import {
  Table,
  Header,
  Body,
  Footer,
  Row,
  Cell,
} from "@jobber/components/Table";
```

<Playground>
  <Table>
    <Header>
      <Cell>Ship</Cell>
      <Cell>Class</Cell>
      <Cell align="right">Cost</Cell>
      <Cell align="right">Crew</Cell>
    </Header>
    <Body>
      <Row>
        <Cell>Nostromo</Cell>
        <Cell>Towing Vehicle</Cell>
        <CellCurrency value={42000000} />
        <CellNumeric value={7} />
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Cell>Rodger Young</Cell>
        <Cell>Corvette Transport</Cell>
        <Cell />
        <CellNumeric value={200} />
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Cell>USS Enterprise</Cell>
        <Cell>Constitution</Cell>
        <Cell />
        <CellNumeric value={205} />
      </Row>
    </Body>
    <Footer>
      <Cell />
      <Cell />
      <Cell />
      <CellNumeric value={412} />
    </Footer>
  </Table>
</Playground>

## Design & usage guidelines

The Table component is a great solution when you need to allow the user to
compare data across items. It's a tried-and-true means of data visualization
that can make reports easier to read.

A best practice in Table presentation is to ensure that all columns with
numerical data (and their headers) round to the same decimal point, and are
right-aligned. This makes it much easier for the reader to quickly parse large
distinctions in dollar amounts, inventory counts, and other key business data.

To list more complex collections of information (such as multi-line content like
a detailed property address), you may want to consider the
[List](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/list) component. If you have a
small list of information with a 1:1 label-to-data relationship (for example,
the issued and due dates on an invoice), consider using
[DescriptionList](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/description-list).

## Props

Table components do not currently accept options.

## Cell types

### Cell

A `Cell` can contain text, or other elements. It can also be used to make
specialized reusable cell types such as `CellNumeric` and `CellCurrency`.

<Props of={Cell} />

### CellNumeric

A `CellNumeric` is used to display numeric values to users in tables. It is
preferred to simply `Cell` as it ensures characters are visually aligned
vertically.

<Props of={CellNumeric} />

### CellCurrency

A `CellCurrency` is used to format and display monetary values.

<Props of={CellCurrency} />
