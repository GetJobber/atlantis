    Gates

## Sizes

`Text` can be used with different sizes.

### Base

`Base` is the default size and is optimized for the widest range of uses,
including:

- Long paragraphs of text content
- Descriptions of subsequent UI elements
- Labels on UI elements such as checkboxes and radio buttons
- Freeform user-generated content

<Playground>
  <Text size="base">
    Stay organized when creating estimates, work orders, and billing documents.
  </Text>
</Playground>

### Large

Typically `large` is to be used as an introductory paragraph that gives
important information about a page, and requires greater prominence.

<Playground>
  <Text size="large">
    Attract new customers by asking happy clients for a Facebook recommendation.
  </Text>
</Playground>

### Small

The `small` size is intended to be used as helper content on things like
checkboxes, radio buttons, inputs or any other UI elements that need help
provided.

<Playground>
  <Text size="small">What is this, a font for 🐜s?</Text>
</Playground>
