## Sizes

### Intro

`Text` can be used with different sizes.

Typically `large` is to be used as an intro text that gives more information
about the page title and can only be used right after a page title.

<Playground>
  <Text size="large">
    Attract new customers by asking happy clients for a Facebook recommendation
  </Text>
</Playground>

The `small` size is intended to be used as small, helper content on things like
checkboxes, radio buttons, inputs or any other UI elements that need help
provided.

<Playground>
  <Text size="small">What is this, a font for üêús?</Text>
</Playground>
