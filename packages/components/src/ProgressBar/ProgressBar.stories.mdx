# ProgressBar

A progress bar is a visual indicator of how close something is to completion.

```ts
import { ProgressBar } from "@jobber/components/ProgressBar";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="ProgressBar"
    args={{
      currentStep: 3,
      totalSteps: 4,
    }}
  >
    {args => <ProgressBar {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={ProgressBar} story="ProgressBar" />

## Design & usage guidelines

The progress bar should be used to show "definite" progress; we know exactly how
close the process is to completion. For "indefinite" progress, where we may not
know exactly how much longer something might take, use a spinner.

Some great use cases for a progress bar include:

- Setup wizard, where we know how many steps the user has completed and how many
  steps remain
- File uploads, where we know the total file size and how much data has already
  been sent

An example where you might be better served using a spinner:

- Loading a calendar within a view, where we do not know it's "complete" until
  there's no more data left to load

## Example with state

<Canvas>
  {() => {
    const [step, setStep] = useState(2);
    const totalSteps = 4;
    return (
      <Content>
        <Button
          label="Step Back"
          onClick={() => setStep(Math.max(0, step - 1))}
        />{" "}
        <Button
          label="Step Forward"
          onClick={() => setStep(Math.min(totalSteps, step + 1))}
        />
        <ProgressBar currentStep={step} totalSteps={totalSteps} />
        Step: <strong>{step}</strong> of <strong>{totalSteps}</strong>
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Canvas>
