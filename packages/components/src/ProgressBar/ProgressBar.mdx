# ProgressBar

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A progress bar is a visual indicator of how close something is to completion.

```ts
import { ProgressBar } from "@jobber/components/ProgressBar";
```

<Playground>
  <ProgressBar currentStep={3} totalSteps={4} />
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The progress bar should be used to show "definite" progress; we know exactly how
close the process is to completion. For "indefinite" progress, where we may not
know exactly how much longer something might take, use a spinner.

Some great use cases for a progress bar include:

- Setup wizard, where we know how many steps the user has completed and how many
  steps remain
- File uploads, where we know the total file size and how much data has already
  been sent

An example where you might be better served using a spinner:

- Loading a calendar within a view, where we do not know it's "complete" until
  there's no more data left to load

## Props

<Props of={ProgressBar} />

## Example with State

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [step, setStep] = useState(2);
    const totalSteps = 4;
    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => setStep(Math.max(0, step - 1))}>
          Step Back
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => setStep(Math.min(totalSteps, step + 1))}>
          Step Forward
        </button>
        <ProgressBar currentStep={step} totalSteps={totalSteps} />
        Step: <strong>{step}</strong> of <strong>{totalSteps}</strong>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>
