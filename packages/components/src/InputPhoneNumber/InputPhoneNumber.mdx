# Input Phone Number

Input phone number should be used anywhere you need to accept phone numbers as
input.

```ts
import { InputPhoneNumber } from "@jobber/components/InputPhoneNumber";
import { Heading } from "@jobber/components/Heading";
```

<Playground>
  <InputPhoneNumber showCountryCode={true} />
</Playground>

## Design Usage & Guidelines

This component is best suited for when you want to ensure the user adhears to a
specific phone number format and present that information in a friendly-easily
consumable way.

## Props

<Props of={InputPhoneNumber} />

## Region Selection

You can select between the countries that are supported.

By default, we will assume `NorthAmerica`

<ul>
  <li> North America </li>
  <li> Great Britain </li>
  <li> Unknown </li>
</ul>

<Playground>
  <InputPhoneNumber region={"GreatBritain"} showCountryCode={true} />
</Playground>

## Always Show Mask

You may not want the mask to appear until a user begins to interact with the
input, in which case you would set this value to false.

By default, we will assume `true`.

<Playground>
  <InputPhoneNumber region={"NorthAmerica"} alwaysShowMask={false} />
</Playground>

## Show Country Code

This switch just hides or shows the country code that precedes the rest of the
input.

By default, we will assume `false`.

<Playground>
  <InputPhoneNumber region={"NorthAmerica"} showCountryCode={true} />
</Playground>
