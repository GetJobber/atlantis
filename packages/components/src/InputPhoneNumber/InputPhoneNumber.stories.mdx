# InputPhoneNumber

Automatically format your user's phone number as they type.

`InputPhoneNumber`'s auto-format is set to always be `(***) ***-****` and
doesn't expect the user to type in their country code. Because phone numbers
vary so much around the world, typing more than 10 digits will turn off the
auto-formatting.

```ts
import { InputPhoneNumber } from "@jobber/components/InputPhoneNumber";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="InputPhoneNumber"
    args={{
      placeholder: "Phone number",
    }}
  >
    {args => {
      const [value, setValue] = useState(args.value);
      return <InputPhoneNumber {...args} value={value} onChange={setValue} />;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={InputPhoneNumber} story="InputPhoneNumber" />

## Usage guidelines

Due to the auto-format, this component is restricted to only be used as a
controlled component. That means the `value` and `onChange` prop is required,
unlike the other input components.

## With country code as a prefix

Keep in mind that the country code won't be added to the value that the
component would return. It is simply for visual purposes.

<Canvas>
  {() => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState("");
    return (
      <InputPhoneNumber
        placeholder="Phone number"
        prefix={{ label: "+1" }}
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue}
      />
    );
  }}
</Canvas>

## Using a custom pattern

`InputPhoneNumber` can have a custom pattern if you wish to use a different
format for the phone number

<Canvas>
  {() => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState("");
    return (
      <InputPhoneNumber
        placeholder="Phone number"
        pattern="(***) ***-**-**"
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue}
      />
    );
  }}
</Canvas>

## Dealing with existing data

`InputPhoneNumber` will respect the format of the initial value you're giving
it. It will only start auto-formatting the existing value when the user edits
the input.

<Canvas>
  {() => {
    const [value, setValue] = useState("555-TUNA");
    return (
      <InputPhoneNumber
        placeholder="Phone number"
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue}
      />
    );
  }}
</Canvas>
