# Feature Switch

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Use the Feature Switch to give users control over a settings-level feature. The
Feature Switch should tell the user what the feature is, allow them to turn it
on and off, and optionally allow them to edit any options applicable to the
feature.

```ts
import { FeatureSwitch } from "@jobber/components/FeatureSwitch";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [featureEnabled, setFeatureEnabled] = useState(true);
    return (
      <FeatureSwitch
        enabled={featureEnabled}
        title="Quote follow-up"
        description="Send a notification to your client following up on an outstanding quote."
        hasSaveIndicator={true}
        onSwitch={handleSwitch}
        onEdit={() => {
          console.log("You clicked edit");
        }}
      >
        <Text>Extra feature content and information</Text>
      </FeatureSwitch>
    );
    function handleSwitch(newValue) {
      setFeatureEnabled(newValue);
    }
  }}
</Playground>

## Design Usage and Guidelines

The Feature Switch is intended to be used in Settings for features that apply to
a system-wide experience. An example of this might be automated messaging
settings, where the user needs to both decide whether or not to use a type of
message, what the message template might be, and when the message should be
sent.

If the user is making a per-use-case on/off decision, such as enabling automatic
payments for a single invoice, use the
[Switch](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/switch) component.

## Simplified

<Playground>
  <FeatureSwitch
    description="Send a notification to your client following up on an outstanding quote"
    onSwitch={newValue => {
      console.log(`Feature ${newValue ? "enabled" : "disabled"}`);
    }}
  />
</Playground>
