# Banner

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Banners provide information about important changes, persistent conditions, and
system errors. They're positioned at the top of the screen or near the content
they reference, and are persistent until dismissed or the issue is resolved.

```ts
import { Banner } from "@jobber/components/Banner";
```

<Playground>
  <Banner type="notice">Your visits are being scheduled</Banner>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Banner} />

## Design & usage guidelines

### Layout and alignment

Banner should align to the left and right of the content it is related to.

When using a Banner within a modal or a page layout, this means Banner should
align to the text, inputs or other UI elements beneath it. For best results, use
[Content](/components/content) to ensure consistent vertical spacing between
Banner and adjacent elements.

If the Banner is being used as a system-wide message or some other context in
which it is outside of the main application layout, it should take up the full
available width.

### Types of Banner

There are four types of Banner, each with guidelines for their usage:

- `notice` [<Icon name="link" />](#notice-message)
- `success` [<Icon name="link" />](#success-message)
- `warning`[<Icon name="link" />](#warning-message)
- `error` [<Icon name="link" />](#error-message)

### Notice message

Use notice banners to provide information about:

<ul>
  <li>new functionality</li>
  <li>background operations</li>
  <li>general non-blocking advice</li>
</ul>

Notices should get to the point and inform the user about why the functionality
or change is important if context is not provided elsewhere.

<Playground>
  <Banner type="notice">
    Your import is in progress. Feel free to leave this page while it continues.
  </Banner>
</Playground>

### Success message

Success banners are appropriate when:

<ul>
  <li>success feedback had a call to action</li>
  <li>success feeback is delayed</li>
</ul>

Otherwise, use [toasts](toast) as the default for success messages.

<Playground>
  <Banner
    type="success"
    primaryAction={{
      label: "View clients",
      onClick: () => alert("🎉 Woo hoo"),
    }}
    dismissible={false}
  >
    Your client import is complete
  </Banner>
</Playground>

### Warning message

Use warning banners when:

<ul>
  <li>an action could have unseen consequences</li>
  <li>additional action has to be taken by the user</li>
</ul>

Warning messages should be one to two short sentences which clearly describe the
possibly unknown impact a user’s changes or actions will have. They should not
begin with "Warning:" and should not be used as a way to block or redirect a
workflow.

You should use [ConfirmationModal](/components/confirmation-modal) when you need
to get explicit confirmation from the user before they complete an action that
is difficult to reverse.

<Playground>
  <Banner type="warning">
    Your subscription will be automatically upgraded in 8 days
  </Banner>
</Playground>

### Error message

Use error banners when:

<ul>
  <li>something requires immediate attention</li>
  <li>blocks the user</li>
</ul>

Errors should explain what happened, and summarize how many issues need to be
addressed in a concise manner. Detailed information about each error is the role
of the [input validation](input-validation) component.

For more guidance on wording, check out the
[Product Vocabulary](../guides/product-vocabulary).

<Playground>
  <Banner type="error">
    Client cannot be saved. 1 change needs to be made:
    <ul>
      <li>Email address</li>
    </ul>
  </Banner>
</Playground>

<br />

System errors should avoid technical or intimidating language, and provide ways
to resolve or troubleshoot the issue if possible.

<Playground>
  <Banner type="error">
    Something went wrong. Please try again in a few minutes.
  </Banner>
</Playground>

## Content guidelines

Content in banner should:

- Be concise and kept to only 1 to 2 sentences where possible
- Avoid exceeding 200 characters
- Follow the [product vocabulary](/content/product-vocabulary) where applicable
- In the case of warning or error banners, explain how to resolve the issue

## Actions in Banners

It is discouraged to use a `<Button />` component when requiring an action
within a `Banner`. If you require an action, use the `primaryActions` prop. The
`primaryAction` accepts the same props as the `Button` component.

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Banner
      type="notice"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "View Plans",
        onClick: () => alert("Plans"),
      }}
      dismissible={false}
    >
      Your trial has been extended!
    </Banner>
    <Banner
      type="error"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "Refresh",
        onClick: () => alert("Refreshing"),
      }}
    >
      Network is unavailable. Please check your internet connection.
    </Banner>
  </Content>
</Playground>

## Related components

- To provide low priority, temporary feedback on the outcome of a user action,
  use [Toast](toast) instead
- Use [ConfirmationModal](/components/confirmation-modal) when you need to get
  explicit confirmation from the user before they complete an action
