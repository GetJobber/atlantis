# Banner

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Banners provide information about important changes, persistent conditions, and
system errors. They're positioned at the top of the screen or near the content
they reference, and are persistent until dismissed or the issue is resolved.

```ts
import { Banner } from "@jobber/components/Banner";
```

<Playground>
  <Banner type="success">You've successfully Hulked out</Banner>
</Playground>

## Props

  </Banner>

## Actions in Banners

It is discouraged to use a `<Button />` component when requiring an action
within a `Banner`. If you require an action, use the `primaryActions` prop. The
`primaryAction` accepts the same props as the `Button` component.

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Banner
      type="success"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "Poke Me",
        onClick: () => alert("ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥SMASHðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥")
      }}
      dismissible={false}
    >
      You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
    </Banner>
    <Banner
      type="notice"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "I'm always angry",
        onClick: () => alert("ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡")
      }}
    >
      That's my secret Captain
    </Banner>
  </Content>
</Playground>

- To provide low priority, temporary feedback on the outcome of a user action,
  use [Toast](toast) instead.
