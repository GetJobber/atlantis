# Banner

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

<Meta title="Components/Status and Feedback/Banner" component={Banner} />

Banners provide information about important changes, persistent conditions, and
system errors. They're positioned at the top of the screen or near the content
they reference, and are persistent until dismissed or the issue is resolved.

```ts
import { Banner } from "@jobber/components/Banner";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Banner"
    args={{ type: "notice", children: "Your visits are being scheduled" }}
  >
    {({ children, ...args }) => <Banner {...args}>{children}</Banner>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Banner} story="Banner" />

## Design & usage guidelines

### Layout and alignment

Banner should align to the left and right of the content it is related to.

When using a Banner within a modal or a page layout, this means Banner should
align to the text, inputs or other UI elements beneath it. For best results, use
[Content](../?path=/docs/components-content--content) to ensure consistent
vertical spacing between Banner and adjacent elements.

If the Banner is being used as a system-wide message or some other context in
which it is outside of the main application layout, it should take up the full
available width.

### Types of Banner

There are four types of Banner, each with guidelines for their usage:

- `notice` [<Icon name="link" />](#notice-message)
- `success` [<Icon name="link" />](#success-message)
- `warning`[<Icon name="link" />](#warning-message)
- `error` [<Icon name="link" />](#error-message)

### Notice message

Use notice banners to provide information about:

<ul>
  <li>new functionality</li>
  <li>background operations</li>
  <li>general non-blocking advice</li>
</ul>

Notices should get to the point and inform the user about why the functionality
or change is important if context is not provided elsewhere.

<Canvas>
  <Banner type="notice">
    Your import is in progress. Feel free to leave this page while it continues.
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Success message

Success banners are appropriate when:

<ul>
  <li>success feedback had a call to action</li>
  <li>success feeback is delayed</li>
</ul>

Otherwise, use [Toast](../?path=/docs/components-toast--toast) as the default
for success messages.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    type="success"
    primaryAction={{
      label: "View clients",
      onClick: () => alert("ðŸŽ‰ Woo hoo"),
    }}
    dismissible={false}
  >
    Your client import is complete
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Warning message

Use warning banners when:

<ul>
  <li>an action could have unseen consequences</li>
  <li>additional action has to be taken by the user</li>
</ul>

Warning messages should be one to two short sentences which clearly describe the
possibly unknown impact a userâ€™s changes or actions will have. They should not
begin with "Warning:" and should not be used as a way to block or redirect a
workflow.

You should use
[ConfirmationModal](../?path=/docs/components-confirmationmodal--confirmation-modal)
when you need to get explicit confirmation from the user before they complete an
action that is difficult to reverse.

<Canvas>
  <Banner type="warning">
    Your subscription will be automatically upgraded in 8 days
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Error message

Use error banners when:

<ul>
  <li>an issue requires immediate attention</li>
  <li>an issue blocks the user</li>
  <li>inline validation can not be used</li>
</ul>

Errors should explain what happened, and how to address the issue in a concise
manner.

If an error is directly related to an input, don't use a banner. Use the
[InputText validation message](../?path=/docs/components-inputtext--input-text/#validation-message)
component or, if unavailable,
[InputValidation](../?path=/docs/components-inputvalidation--input-validation).
Scroll to the first affected field on submission.

For more guidance on wording, check out the
[Product Vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--page).

<Canvas>
  <Banner type="error">
    This link has expired. Please try again using the most recent email in your
    inbox, or request a new link.
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

<br />

System errors should avoid technical or intimidating language, and provide ways
to resolve or troubleshoot the issue if possible.

<Canvas>
  <Banner type="error">
    Something went wrong. Please try again in a few minutes.
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

Content in banner should:

- Be concise and kept to only 1 to 2 sentences where possible
- Avoid exceeding 200 characters
- Follow the
  [Product Vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--page) where
  applicable
- In the case of warning or error banners, explain how to resolve the issue

## Actions in Banners

It is discouraged to use a `<Button />` component when requiring an action
within a `Banner`. If you require an action, use the `primaryActions` prop. The
`primaryAction` accepts the same props as the `Button` component.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Banner
      type="notice"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "View Plans",
        onClick: () => alert("Plans"),
      }}
      dismissible={false}
    >
      Your trial has been extended!
    </Banner>
    <Banner
      type="error"
      primaryAction={{
        label: "Refresh",
        onClick: () => alert("Refreshing"),
      }}
    >
      Network is unavailable. Please check your internet connection.
    </Banner>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Related components

- To provide low priority, temporary feedback on the outcome of a user action,
  use [Toast](../?path=/docs/components-toast--toast) instead
- Use
  [ConfirmationModal](../?path=/docs/components-confirmationmodal--confirmation-modal)
  when you need to get explicit confirmation from the user before they complete
  an action
