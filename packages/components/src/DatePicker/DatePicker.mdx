# Date Picker

A `DatePicker` is used to allow a user to select a date from a visual calendar
interface.

While this component can be used in isolation, the intention is that in many
cases it will supplement an input component to provide the user with a
multi-mode opportunity to select a date.

```ts
import { DatePicker } from "@jobber/components/DatePicker";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [date, setDate] = useState();
    return (
      <Content>
        <DatePicker selected={date} onChange={setDate} />
        {date && <DataDump defaultOpen data={date} />}
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={DatePicker} />

## Design & Usage Guidelines

Use Datepicker when you are looking to provide the user with a highly visual
interface for intuitive date selections.

A classic use case for a standalone Datepicker would be as a means to navigate
within a larger calendar interface.

It may be beneficial to supplement the Datepicker with alternate means of
entering their date selection, such as providing a `date` input.

### Inline

Use an inline Datepicker when you have sufficient space in the interface to have
a permanent date selection fixture, or when date selection is the primary
function of the interface, such as a stepped flow where the user is being asked
a series of scheduling questions individually, in sequence.

In cases like complex scheduling forms where all the factors of a schedule such
as times, repeating frequency, and duration are being asked, consider using the
default popover-type behaviour for those use cases to reduce an overwhelming
volume of UI elements to process at once.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [date, setDate] = useState();
    return (
      <Content>
        <div>
          <DatePicker selected={date} inline onChange={setDate} />
        </div>
        {date && <DataDump defaultOpen data={date} />}
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Custom Activator

If you want to use a different activator to display the `DatePicker` you can
pass a `React` component as the `activator`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [date, setDate] = useState();
    return (
      <Content>
        <DatePicker
          selected={date}
          onChange={setDate}
          activator={<Button label="My fancy activator" variation="learning" />}
        />
        {date && <DataDump defaultOpen data={date} />}
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Disabling dates

If you want to enable for selection only for a set of dates you can pass
`minDate` or `maxDate` to the component as props.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date("02/17/2022"));
    return (
      <Content>
        <div>
          <DatePicker
            minDate={new Date("02/07/2022")}
            maxDate={new Date("02/27/2022")}
            selected={date}
            inline
            onChange={setDate}
          />
        </div>
        {date && <DataDump defaultOpen data={date} />}
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Accessibility

At this point, the `DatePicker` component is a wrapped version of
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/). This means that the
accessibility of the component is handled by the `React DatePicker` component.

Users can operate all of the controls by keyboard, including the `tab` to cycle
between Next/Previous month and the calendar, arrow keys to navigate between
dates, and `space` and/or `return` to make selections. Pressing `escape` will
close the Datepicker.

The date available for selection is read aloud to assistive technology in the
format "Choose {date} (button)". For example, "Choose December 1st, 2021
(button)".

If using a custom activator, ensure that the activator is keyboard-operable.

## Related Components

- If you are looking to use the `DatePicker` in a `Form`, consider the
  [InputDate](/components/input-date) component.
- For a time input, use [InputTime](/components/input-time)
- To present dates that have already been selected in a consistent format, use
  [FormatDate](/components/date-formatter)
- To represent past or future dates and times, use
  [FormatRelativeDateTime](/components/format-relative-date-time)

## Notes

As mentioned above, the Datepicker wraps
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/).
