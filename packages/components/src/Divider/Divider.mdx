# Divider

Divider is a UI element meant to divide two areas of content.

```ts
import { Divider } from "@jobber/components/Divider";
```

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Content>Some amazing content</Content>
    <Divider />
    <Content>Even more amazing content</Content>
  </Content>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Divider} />

## Usage Guidelines

The `Divider` component comes with no spacing around it. This means that it
should be used within a [`Content`](/components/content) component.

## Accessibility

`Divider` uses an `hr` element internally, but as its' decorative use in
dividing UI differs from the semantic intent of breaking up paragraphs, it is
rendered with a `role="none"` to avoid overwhelming screen-reader users with
un-helpful noise.
