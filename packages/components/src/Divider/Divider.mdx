# Divider

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="no" />

Divider is a UI element meant to divide to areas of content.

```ts
import { Divider } from "@jobber/components/Divider";
```

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Content>Some amazing content</Content>
    <Divider />
    <Content>Even more amazing content</Content>
  </Content>
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The `Divider` component comes with no spacing around it. This means that it
should be used within a [`Content`](/components/content) component.

## Props

<Props of={Divider} />

            Squatty and slightly square at the edges, these bananas are slightly
            tangy and lemony. When ripe, the fruit is soft and the skin is
            yellow with black spots. Also called Horse, Hog, or Orinoco bananas.

            This is the familiar yellow banana sold in United Statesâ€™
            supermarkets. There are also other sizes of Cavendish, including
            Dwarf and Giant, though they are difficult to find.
