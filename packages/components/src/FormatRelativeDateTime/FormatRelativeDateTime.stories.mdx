# FormatRelativeDateTime

A FormatRelateDateTime displays the date and time using relative wording or
approximate values. Note. This component only represents current date and dates
in the past. No future dating.

```ts
import { FormatRelativeDateTime } from "@jobber/components/FormatRelativeDateTime";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="FormatRelativeDateTime"
    args={{
      date: new Date(new Date().setMinutes(new Date().getMinutes() - 5)),
    }}
  >
    {args => <FormatRelativeDateTime {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={FormatRelativeDateTime} story="FormatRelativeDateTime" />

## Rules

If the message was received less than an hour ago the format is x minutes ago

If the message was received today, but more than an hour ago, the format becomes
the hours and minutes it was received at

If the message was received within the last six days, the format is Sun, Mon,
Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat

If the message was received between six days ago and yesterdayâ€™s date one year
previous, the format is Month Date

If the message was received exactly one year ago or more than one year ago, the
format is Month Day, Year
