# FormatRelativeDateTime

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A FormatRelateDateTime displays the date and time using relative wording or
approximate values. Note. This component only represents current date and dates
in the past. No future dating.

## Simple Example

```ts
import { FormatRelativeDateTime } from "@jobber/components/FormatRelativeDateTime";
```

## Rules

If the message was received less than an hour ago the format is x minutes ago

If the message was received today, but more than an hour ago, the format becomes
the time it was received

If the message was received this within the last six days, the format is Sun,
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat

If the message was received between six days ago and yesterday’s date one year
previous, the format is Month Date

If the message was received exactly one year ago or more than one year ago, the
format is Month Day, Year
