# FormatRelativeDateTime

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A FormatRelateDateTime displays the date and time using relative wording or
approximate values.

Rules: If the message was received less than an hour ago the format is x minutes
ago

If the message was received today, but more than an hour ago, the format becomes
the time it was received

If the message was received this within the last six days, the format is Sun,
Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat

If the message was received between six days ago and yesterdayâ€™s date one year
previous, the format is Month Date

If the message was received exactly one year ago or more than one year ago, the
format is Month Day, Year

## Simple Example

import { FormatRelativeDateTime } from "@jobber/components/FormatRelativeDateTime";
```

<Playground>
  <FormatRelativeDateTime date={new CivilDate(2020, 2, 26)} />
</Playground>
