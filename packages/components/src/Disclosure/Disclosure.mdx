# Disclosure

```ts
import { Disclosure } from "@jobber/components/Disclosure";
```

<Playground>
  <Disclosure title="Open to see more content organa palpatine lobot jawa kamino.">
    <Content>
      <Text>
        Lucas ipsum dolor sit amet darth sebulba solo vader yoda bothan wedge
        kenobi dantooine hutt.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Moff qui-gonn darth leia solo hutt gonk darth. Skywalker tatooine
        dagobah thrawn.
      </Text>
    </Content>
  </Disclosure>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Disclosure} />

## Usage Guidelines

The `<Disclosure>` will reveal and hide additional information that our users
may care about, should they choose to learn more about it.

## Content Guidelines

- **Title** should be informative and label the type of content grouped in the
  body content in it
  - uses `<Heading level={4}>` component
- **Content** should be actionable and clear. May contain:
  - good olâ€™ plain text
  - accepts any React component as a child
  - except: `<Page>`, `<Table>`

## Accessibility

- Users should be able to use their keyboard and toggle the component's
  open/close state
- Headings are permitted in `<summary>` elements to provide in-page navigational
  assistance
- Include aria-expanded attribute on the trigger to communicate to assistive
  technology
- Include aria-controls attribute ties on the trigger to the content it controls
  using the id of the collapsible container
- The trigger contains a downward-pointing-arrow to hint that it can be
  expanded. when the disclosure item is in expanded state, this is rotated 180
  degrees to point upwards
- The icon will be given an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide it from
  assistive technologies, as well as `focusable="false"` to address an
  inconsistency in IE and older versions of Edge

## Responsiveness

- This component should handle both click and touch, as well as keyboard inputs
- This component should fill the width of its container
- If the component is less than `375px` wide, the title will wrap and should not
  be truncated
- Text increases/decreases when user zooms in/out

## Notes

### Trade-offs, considerations, and things we want to remember

- We may, in the future, setup an onchange handler that receives
  expanded/collapsed events. For example so other parts of a page, SPA or not,
  can subscribe to this and react accordingly.
- While this is roughly based on a legacy Jobber implementation of an accordion,
  we haven't fleshed out exactly how Disclosure will behave and look if used in
  an accordion fashion
- **Assumption**: `<Heading level=4>` should solve most use cases for this
  component. We did consider the possibility of opening this up to other levels
  but for a simpler end-user experience are not making the heading level
  configurable from the component API at this time.
