# Disclosure

```ts
import { Disclosure } from "@jobber/components/Disclosure";
```

The `<Disclosure>` will reveal and hide additional information that the user may
care about, should they choose to learn more about it.

<Playground>
  <Disclosure title="Advanced instructions">
    <Content>
      <Text>Here is some helpful information to level up your business:</Text>
      <Text>For every 2 team members you add, your profits will triple.</Text>
    </Content>
  </Disclosure>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Disclosure} />

## Usage Guidelines

Use `Disclosure`for progressive... _disclosure..._ of elements that aren't
essential for the user to view all at once. You may want to put content inside
of a `Disclosure` to...

- reduce distractions or avoid overwhelming the user
- hide non-critical controls or options in a form

`Disclosure` should only be used to contain content or controls that aren't
required for the user to complete the primary objective of a given view. For
example, if a user has to make a selection between two options to complete a
task, do not put the selection controls in a `Disclosure`, but if there is an
optional setting that a user _may_ want to change but is not required to, a
`Disclosure` would do the trick nicely.

## Content Guidelines

- **Title** should be informative and label the type of content grouped in the
  body content in it
  - uses `<Heading level={4}>` component
- **Content** should be actionable and clear. May contain:
  - good olâ€™ plain text
  - accepts any React component as a child
  - except: `<Page>`, `<Table>`

## Accessibility

- Users should be able to use their keyboard and toggle the component's
  open/close state
- Headings are permitted in `<summary>` elements to provide in-page navigational
  assistance
- Include aria-expanded attribute on the trigger to communicate to assistive
  technology
- Include aria-controls attribute ties on the trigger to the content it controls
  using the id of the collapsible container
- The trigger contains a downward-pointing-arrow to hint that it can be
  expanded. when the disclosure item is in expanded state, this is rotated 180
  degrees to point upwards
- The icon will be given an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide it from
  assistive technologies, as well as `focusable="false"` to address an
  inconsistency in IE and older versions of Edge

## Responsiveness

- This component should handle both click and touch, as well as keyboard inputs
- This component should fill the width of its container
- If the component is less than `375px` wide, the title will wrap and should not
  be truncated
- Text increases/decreases when user zooms in/out

## Notes

### Trade-offs, considerations, and things we want to remember

- We may, in the future, setup an onchange handler that receives
  expanded/collapsed events. For example so other parts of a page, SPA or not,
  can subscribe to this and react accordingly.
- While this is roughly based on a legacy Jobber implementation of an accordion,
  we haven't fleshed out exactly how Disclosure will behave and look if used in
  an accordion fashion
- **Assumption**: `<Heading level=4>` should solve most use cases for this
  component. We did consider the possibility of opening this up to other levels
  but for a simpler end-user experience are not making the heading level
  configurable from the component API at this time.
