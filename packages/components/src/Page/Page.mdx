# Page

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="yes" />

Use Page to build the outermost "main content" container of a view. Page comes
complete with the ability to add the page title, along with actions and a
description as needed.

```ts
import { Page } from "@jobber/components/Page";
```

<Playground>
  <Page
    title="Notifications"
    intro="Improve job completion rates, stop chasing payments, and boost your customer service by automatically communicating with your clients at key points before, during, and after a job. Read more about Notifications by visiting our [Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009737128)."
  >
    <Text>Page content here</Text>
  </Page>
</Playground>

## Design Usage and Guidelines

Using Page is pretty straightforward - after any navigational elements, Page
should contain the content the user will be engaging with. If there is any sort
of footer, it should exist after Page.

## Props

<Props of={Page} />

## Page with Actions

<Playground>
  <Page
    title="Action Notifications"
    intro="This isn't just talk. Get into action with some buttons and menus."
    primaryAction={{ label: "Send Food", onClick: () => alert("🥨") }}
    secondaryAction={{ label: "Send Drink", onClick: () => alert("🍹") }}
    moreActionsMenu={[
      {
        actions: [
          {
            label: "Edit",
            icon: "edit",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("✏️");
            }
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        header: "Send as...",
        actions: [
          {
            label: "Text Message",
            icon: "sms",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("📱");
            }
          },
          {
            label: "Email",
            icon: "email",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("📨");
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]}
  >
    <Content>
      <Text>Page content here</Text>
    </Content>
  </Page>
</Playground>
