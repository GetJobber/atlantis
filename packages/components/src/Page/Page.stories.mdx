# Page

<Meta title="Components/Layouts and Structure/Page" component={Page} />

Use Page to build the outermost "main content" container of a view. Page comes
complete with the ability to add the page title, along with actions, subtitle,
and a description as needed.

```ts
import { Page } from "@jobber/components/Page";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Page"
    args={{
      title: "Notifications",
      intro:
        "Improve job completion rates, stop chasing payments, and boost your customer service by automatically communicating with your clients at key points before, during, and after a job. Read more about Notifications by visiting our [Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us).",
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <Page {...args}>
        <Text>Page content here</Text>
      </Page>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Page} story="Page" />

## Design & usage guidelines

Using Page is pretty straightforward - after any navigational elements, Page
should contain the content the user will be engaging with. If there is any sort
of footer, it should exist after Page.

### Widths

#### Narrow

Use a `narrow` Page when the content is optimized for a single column, such as a
form design.

#### Standard

Use a `standard` Page for most "show" state layouts, as it allows for a mix of
contents in a multi-column layout while keeping things constrained so the user
does not have to track too far left-to-right as they interact.

#### Fill

A `fill` Page should be used when the content is optimized for wider views, such
as responsive dashboards and data visualizations, data tables, calendars, or
otherwise does not benefit from horizontal constraints.

## Page with actions

<Canvas>
  <Page
    title="Notification Settings"
    intro="This isn't just talk. Get into action with some buttons and menus."
    primaryAction={{ label: "Send Food Alert", onClick: () => alert("🥨") }}
    secondaryAction={{ label: "Send Drink Alert", onClick: () => alert("🍹") }}
    moreActionsMenu={[
      {
        actions: [
          {
            label: "Edit",
            icon: "edit",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("✏️");
            },
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        header: "Send as...",
        actions: [
          {
            label: "Text Message",
            icon: "sms",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("📱");
            },
          },
          {
            label: "Email",
            icon: "email",
            onClick: () => {
              alert("📨");
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ]}
  >
    <Content>
      <Text>Page content here</Text>
    </Content>
  </Page>
</Canvas>

## Page with subtitle

Use a subtitle when you need to supplement a page title.

<Canvas>
  <Page
    title="Notifications"
    subtitle="Notify me of all the work"
    intro="Improve job completion rates, stop chasing payments, and boost your customer service by automatically communicating with your clients at key points before, during, and after a job. Read more about Notifications by visiting our [Help Center](https://help.getjobber.com/hc/en-us)."
  >
    <Text>Page content here</Text>
  </Page>
</Canvas>
