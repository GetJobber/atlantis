# Card

<ComponentStatus stage="rc" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

In Jobber a card is used to group related information and tasks to make things
easier to scan, and action upon. Cards also contain many optional sub-components
to provide extra structure in a predictable way.

## Simple Card

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <p>This is justâ€¦</p>
    <p>A simple card.</p>
  </Card>
</Playground>

## Clickable Cards

<Playground>
  <Card url="#">
    <p>I'm a link!</p>
  </Card>

  <Card onClick={(e) => { alert("ðŸ˜»"); console.log(e.currentTarget);}}>
    <p>I like to be clicked!</p>
  </Card>
</Playground>

## Card with Title

<Playground>
  <Card accent="jobColor">
    <Title title="This is an exceptionally long card title" />

    <p>This is the card content.</p>

  </Card>
</Playground>

## â–¸ `Title`

The `Title` defines the title of a card. This is used to provide context as to
the content of the card.

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <Title title="Sample Title" />

  </Card>
</Playground>

<Props of={Title} />
