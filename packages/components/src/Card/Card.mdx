# Card

<ComponentStatus stage="rc" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

In Jobber a card is used to group related information and tasks to make things
easier to scan, and action upon. Cards also contain many optional sub-components
to provide extra structure in a predictable way.

## Simple Card

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <p>This is just…</p>
    <p>A simple card.</p>
  </Card>
</Playground>

## Clickable Cards

<Playground>
  <Card url="#">
    <p>I'm a link!</p>
  </Card>

  <Card onClick={() => { alert("😻"); }}>
    <p>I like to be clicked!</p>
  </Card>
</Playground>

## Card with Header

<Playground>
  <Card accent="jobColor">
    <CardTitle title="This is an exceptionally long card title" />

    <p>This is the card content.</p>

  </Card>
</Playground>

## Card Properties

## ▸ `CardTitle`

The `CardTitle` defines the title of a card. This is used to provide context as
to the content of the card.

<Playground>
  <Card>
    <CardTitle title="Sample Title" />

  </Card>
</Playground>

<Props of={CardTitle} />
