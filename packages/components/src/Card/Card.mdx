# Card

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A card is used to group related information and tasks so our users can scan and
prioritize information more easily.

```ts
import { Card } from "@jobber/components/Card";
```

<Playground>
  <Card title="Banana">
    <Content>
      <Heading level={4}>Burro</Heading>
      <Text>
        Squatty and slightly square at the edges, these bananas are slightly
        tangy and lemony. When ripe, the fruit is soft and the skin is yellow
        with black spots. Also called Horse, Hog, or Orinoco bananas.
      </Text>
      <Heading level={4}>Cavendish</Heading>
      <Text>
        This is the familiar yellow banana sold in United States’ supermarkets.
        There are also other sizes of Cavendish, including Dwarf and Giant,
        though they are difficult to find.

## Design & Usage Guidelines

A card is useful for grouping content because of it's distinct visual
boundaries. However, similar to the idea that "making everything stand out means
that nothing stands out", you should be mindful in your application of cards.

A card should be the smallest-possible self-contained section of content. If you
find yourself putting a card inside of another card, the outer card should be
removed, and it may be worth re-assessing the hierarchy of your interface.
