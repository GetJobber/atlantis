scan, and action upon

      <Text>
        Squatty and slightly square at the edges, these bananas are slightly
        tangy and lemony. When ripe, the fruit is soft and the skin is yellow
        with black spots. Also called Horse, Hog, or Orinoco bananas.

        This is the familiar yellow banana sold in United States’ supermarkets.
        There are also other sizes of Cavendish, including Dwarf and Giant,
