# Card

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A card is used to group related information and tasks to make things easier to
scan, and action upon

```ts
import { Card } from "@jobber/components/Card";
```

<Playground>
  <Card title="Banana">
    <Content>
      <Heading level={4}>Burro</Heading>
      <Text>
        Squatty and slightly square at the edges, these bananas are slightly
        tangy and lemony. When ripe, the fruit is soft and the skin is yellow
        with black spots. Also called Horse, Hog, or Orinoco bananas.
      </Text>
      <Heading level={4}>Cavendish</Heading>
      <Text>
        This is the familiar yellow banana sold in United Statesâ€™ supermarkets.
        There are also other sizes of Cavendish, including Dwarf and Giant,
        though they are difficult to find.

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The primary utility of a card is its' grouping of elements by proximity within a clear boundary, clearly marked by a header.

A card should be the smallest-possible self-contained section of content. If you find yourself putting a card inside of another card, the outer card should be removed, and it may be worth re-assessing the hierarchy of your interface.
