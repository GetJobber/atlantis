# Card

<Meta title="Components/Card" component={Card} />

A card is used to group related information and tasks so our users can scan and
prioritize information more easily.

```ts
import { Card } from "@jobber/components/Card";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Card"
    args={{
      header: {
        title: "Company settings",
        action: <Button label="Add New Setting" />,
      },
    }}
  >
    {args => (
      <Card {...args}>
        <Content>
          <Heading level={4}>Details</Heading>
          <InputGroup>
            <InputText
              defaultValue="Quest Provider"
              placeholder="Company name"
            />
            <InputText placeholder="Years in business" />
          </InputGroup>
          <Heading level={4}>Contact</Heading>
          <InputGroup>
            <InputText
              prefix={{
                icon: "phone",
              }}
              placeholder="Phone number"
            />
            <InputText
              prefix={{
                icon: "presentation",
              }}
              placeholder="Website"
            />
            <InputText
              prefix={{
                icon: "email",
              }}
              placeholder="Email"
            />
          </InputGroup>
        </Content>
      </Card>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Card} story="Card" />

## Design & usage guidelines

A card is useful for grouping content because of it's distinct visual
boundaries. However, similar to the idea that "making everything stand out means
that nothing stands out", you should be mindful in your application of cards.

A card should be the smallest-possible self-contained section of content. If you
find yourself putting a card inside of another card, the outer card should be
removed, and it may be worth re-assessing the hierarchy of your interface.

## Content guidelines

Card titles should be sentence-cased.

| ‚úÖ Do                   | ‚ùå Don't                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Client property details | Client Property Details |
| Assigned team           | ASSIGNED TEAM           |
| Required deposit        | Required Deposit        |

## Variations

### Header with action

Pass a Button in as the header action to present the user with an action related
to the Card contents.

<Canvas>
  <Card
    header={{
      title: "Services",
      action: (
        <Button label="Add New Service" onClick={() => alert("Dismiss")} />
      ),
    }}
  >
    <List
      items={[
        {
          id: 1,
          title: "Home Cleaning - 2 Bed 2 Bath",
          content: "Basic clean for 2 bedrooms 2 bathrooms",
          value: "$250.00",
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          title: "Kitchen Cleaning",
          content: "Basic clean for 1 kitchen - includes stove and fridge",
          value: "$175.00",
        },
        {
          id: 3,
          title: "Baseboard Cleaning",
          content:
            "Ensure that baseboards are cleaned in addition to walls and floors",
          value: "$25.00",
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Card>
</Canvas>

### Header with multiple actions

Pass a Menu in as the header action to present the user with multiple actions
related to the Card contents.

<!--
<Canvas>
  <Card
    header={{
      action:
        <Menu
          items={[
            actions: [
              {

                label: "Edit",
                onClick: {() => alert("Dismiss")},
              },
              {
                icon: "sms",
                label: "Text message",
                onClick: {() => alert("Dismiss")},
              },
              {
                icon: "email",
                label: "Email",
                onClick: {() => alert("Dismiss")},
              }
            ]
          ]}
        />
      ,
      title: "Services",
    }}
  >
    <List
      items={[
        {

          value: "$175.00",

        {
