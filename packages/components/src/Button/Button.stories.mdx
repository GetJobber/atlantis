# Button

Buttons are a core user interface component, as they allow users to initiate,
complete, and reverse actions.

```ts
import { Button } from "@jobber/components/Button";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Button"
    args={{
      label: "Press Me!",
      onPress: () => alert("👍"),
    }}
  >
    {args => <Button {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Button} story="Button" />

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The right button to use depends on:

- the type of action your user is attempting to complete
- the hierarchy of the interface the button lives in

### Work actions

Use Work Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of completing
work in Jobber.

#### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the thing" />
</Canvas>

#### Secondary

A secondary button should be used when...

- there is one or more alternative, but less important, actions to the primary
  action

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the thing" type="secondary" />
</Canvas>

#### Tertiary

A tertiary button should be used to complete actions within the view such as
editing, revealing details, or navigating within the view.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the thing" type="tertiary" />
</Canvas>

### Learning Actions

Use the Learning Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of
learning about Jobber, whether for marketing or coaching purposes.

#### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="secondary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="tertiary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Destructive Actions

Destructive actions remove something from Jobber.

#### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
signficant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action should
be contained in a [ConfirmationModal](/components/confirmation-modal) triggered
by clicking a secondary or tertiary destructive button.

#### Secondary or Tertiary

A Secondary or tertiary destructive action will either...

- destroy an item on an object that can be quickly restored, such as a line item
  on a job
- trigger a dialog to confirm a Primary destructive action

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="secondary" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="tertiary" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Subtle Actions

> Subtle actions replace a previous concept of "cancel" actions which has been
> deprecated.

Use a subtle button when you want the visual appearance to be more, well...
_subtle._ This variation of button uses subdued color, allowing it to sit
comfortably alongside more prominent content.

Think of icon actions in a navigation bar, buttons to dismiss a modal, or opting
out of completing an action they have triggered.

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary

A key distinction between subtle buttons and the other variations is that the
primary/secondary/tertiary scale is styled differently, but the conceptual
hierarchy is the same. Notably, the tertiary subtle button has a transparent
background, allowing it to be _extra_ subtle when placed overtop
`surface--background` elements such as a Modal header.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Cancel" type="primary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Dismiss" type="secondary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Maybe Later" type="tertiary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
    </Content>
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--background)",
        padding: "var(--space-base)",
      }}
    >
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="search"
        aria-label="search"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="cog"
        aria-label="settings"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="help"
        aria-label="help"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="more"
        aria-label="more"
      />
    </div>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

As a best practice, do not design with disabled button states. This has negative
impacts on accessibility as well as an increase in complexity for users to
understand why the interface is disabled and how to resolve it.

With that said, if you _can't_ design a flow without a disabled state, this is
how you disable a button.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the thing" disabled />
</Canvas>

## Sizes

Buttons come in three sizes. `Base` is the default and should be used for almost
every use case.

Only use `large` for extremely spacious interfaces such as a login form, and
`small` when the interface has extremely tight size constraints.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Small" size="small" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Base" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Large" size="large" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Icons

You can use icons inside the buttons. They can stand-alone, or appear before,
after, or on top of the button label. They can also be added before or after the
label.

**Note:** If an icon is used in a stand-alone method, an `ariaLabel` must be
present to describe the button.

<Canvas>
  <Button type="secondary" icon="user" ariaLabel="I'm a person" />
  <Button label="More" type="secondary" icon="more" />
  <Button
    label="Actions"
    type="secondary"
    icon="arrowDown"
    iconOnRight={true}
  />
</Canvas>

## Loading

A way to communicate to the user that a background action is being performed.

<Canvas>
  <Button
    label="Deleting..."
    type="primary"
    variation="destructive"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button
    label="Loading..."
    type="tertiary"
    variation="learning"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button label="Canceling..." variation="subtle" loading={true} />
</Canvas>

## Client Side Routing

A `Button` can be used for client-side routing as well. When using a Button to
handle the client-side routing, use the `to` prop. Notice when you click below
that the URL will change to the appropriate route.

<Canvas>
  <Router basename="/components/button">
    <Button label="Home" to="/" />
    <Button label="Office" to="/office" />
    <Button label="Dentist" to="/dentist" />
    <hr />
    <Switch>
      <Route exact path="/">
        This is my home, time to get cozy.
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/office">
        This is my office, time to get to work.
      </Route>
      <Route exact path="/dentist">
        This is the dentist, time to get my teeth fixed.
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  </Router>
</Canvas>

## Form Submit

Passing the `submit` prop will allow a `Button` to submit a
[Form](/components/form). Since submitting a form is a specific action, only
`variation="work"` and `type="primary"` are allowed.

Since this type of `Button` will only be used to submit a form, it does not make
sense to allow the `external`, `onClick`, `to`, or `url` props.

<Canvas>
  <Form onSubmit={() => alert("Wow, what a number")}>
    <Content>
      <InputNumber placeholder="Pick a number" />
      <Button label="Submit" submit={true} />
    </Content>
  </Form>
</Canvas>
