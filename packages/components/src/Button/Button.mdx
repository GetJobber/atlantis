# Button

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

Buttons are a core user interface component, as they allow users to initiate,
complete, and reverse actions. Button classes can be applied to a number of HTML
elements button, anchor, or submit inputs. We should always use semantic
elements for buttons in favour of things like spans or divs so we get
accessibility out of the box.

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Submit"
    onClick={() => {
      alert("âœ…");
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Work actions

Use Work Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of completing
work in Jobber.

### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" />
</Playground>

### Secondary

A secondary button should be used when...

- there is one or more alternative, but less important, actions to the primary
  action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" variation="secondary" />
</Playground>

### Tertiary

A tertiary button should be used to complete actions within the view such as
editing, revealing details, or navigating within the view.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" variation="tertiary" />
</Playground>

## Learning Actions

Use the Learning Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of
learning about Jobber, whether for marketing or coaching purposes.

### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    type="learning"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    type="learning"
    variation="secondary"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    type="learning"
    variation="tertiary"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Destructive Actions

Destructive actions remove something from Jobber.

### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
signficant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action should
be contained in a confirmation dialog triggered by clicking a Secondary
destructive button.

### Secondary

A Secondary destructive action will either...

- destroy an item on an object that can be quickly restored, such as a line item
  on a job
- trigger a dialog to confirm a Primary destructive action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" type="destructive" />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" type="destructive" variation="secondary" />
</Playground>

## Cancel Actions

Cancel actions allow the user to opt out of completing an action they have
triggered, whether that action is Work, Learning, or Destructive.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Cancel" type="cancel" />
</Playground>

## Disabled

Buttons can be disabled for a number of reasons, users may need to do an action
first or they may not be ready to use that button.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" disabled />
</Playground>

## Sizes

Buttons comes in 2 extra sizes.

### Small

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" size="small" />
</Playground>

### Large

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" size="large" />
</Playground>

## Button Properties

<Props of={Button} />
