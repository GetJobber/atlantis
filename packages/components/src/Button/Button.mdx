# Button

<ComponentStatus stage="rc" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Buttons are a core user interface component, as they allow users to initiate,
complete, and reverse actions.

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Submit"
    onClick={() => {
      alert("✅");
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Button Properties

<Props of={Button} />

## Work actions

Use Work Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of completing
work in Jobber.

### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" />
</Playground>

### Secondary

A secondary button should be used when...

- there is one or more alternative, but less important, actions to the primary
  action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" type="secondary" />
</Playground>

### Tertiary

A tertiary button should be used to complete actions within the view such as
editing, revealing details, or navigating within the view.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" type="tertiary" />
</Playground>

## Learning Actions

Use the Learning Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of
learning about Jobber, whether for marketing or coaching purposes.

### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    variation="learning"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    variation="learning"
    type="secondary"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Learn More"
    variation="learning"
    type="tertiary"
    url="//getjobber.com"
    external={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Destructive Actions

Destructive actions remove something from Jobber.

### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
signficant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action should
be contained in a confirmation dialog triggered by clicking a Secondary
destructive button.

### Secondary

A Secondary destructive action will either...

- destroy an item on an object that can be quickly restored, such as a line item
  on a job
- trigger a dialog to confirm a Primary destructive action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="secondary" />
</Playground>

## Cancel Actions

Cancel actions allow the user to opt out of completing an action they have
triggered, whether that action is Work, Learning, or Destructive.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Cancel" variation="cancel" />
</Playground>

## Disabled

Buttons can be disabled for a number of reasons, users may need to do an action
first or they may not be ready to use that button.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" disabled />
</Playground>

## Sizes

Buttons comes in 2 extra sizes.

### Small

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" size="small" />
</Playground>

### Large

<Playground>
  <Button label="Submit" size="large" />
</Playground>

## Icons

You can use icons inside buttons. They can stand-alone, or appear before, after,
or on top of the button label. They can also be added before or after the label.

<Playground>
  <Button label="More" type="secondary" icon="more" />
  <br />
  <br />
  <Button
    label="Actions"
    type="secondary"
    icon="arrowDown"
    iconOnRight={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Loading

A way to communicate to the user that a background action is being performed.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Deleting..." type="primary" variation="destructive" loading />
  <br />
  <br />
  <Button label="Loading..." type="tertiary" variation="learning" loading />
  <br />
  <br />
  <Button label="Canceling..." variation="cancel" loading />
</Playground>
