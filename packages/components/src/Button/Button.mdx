# Button

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Buttons are a core user interface component, as they allow users to initiate,
complete, and reverse actions.

```ts
import { Button } from "@jobber/components/Button";
```

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Do the thing"
    onClick={() => {
      alert("✅");
    }}
  />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Button} />

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The right button to use depends on:

- the type of action your user is attempting to complete
- the hierarchy of the interface the button lives in

### Work actions

Use Work Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of completing
work in Jobber.

#### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" />
</Playground>

#### Secondary

A secondary button should be used when...

- there is one or more alternative, but less important, actions to the primary
  action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" type="secondary" />
</Playground>

#### Tertiary

A tertiary button should be used to complete actions within the view such as
editing, revealing details, or navigating within the view.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" type="tertiary" />
</Playground>

### Learning Actions

Use the Learning Actions buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of
learning about Jobber, whether for marketing or coaching purposes.

#### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Button
      label="Learn More"
      variation="learning"
      url="//getjobber.com"
      external={true}
    />

    <Button
      label="Learn More"
      variation="learning"
      type="secondary"
      url="//getjobber.com"
      external={true}
    />

    <Button
      label="Learn More"
      variation="learning"
      type="tertiary"
      url="//getjobber.com"
      external={true}
    />

  </Content>
</Playground>

### Destructive Actions

Destructive actions remove something from Jobber.

#### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
signficant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action should
be contained in a confirmation dialog triggered by clicking a Secondary
destructive button.

#### Secondary or Tertiary

A Secondary or tertiary destructive action will either...

- destroy an item on an object that can be quickly restored, such as a line item
  on a job
- trigger a dialog to confirm a Primary destructive action

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" />
</Playground>

<Playground>
  <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="secondary" />
</Playground>

### Cancel Actions

Cancel actions allow the user to opt out of completing an action they have
triggered, whether that action is Work, Learning, or Destructive.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Cancel" variation="cancel" />
</Playground>

## Disabled

Buttons can be disabled for a number of reasons, users may need to do an action
first or they may not be ready to use that button.

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" disabled />
</Playground>

## Sizes

Buttons comes in 2 extra sizes.

### Small

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" size="small" />
</Playground>

### Large

<Playground>
  <Button label="Do the thing" size="large" />
</Playground>

### Subtle Actions

Use for any variation of button when you want the visual appearnce to be more,
well... subtle.

Think of icon actions in a navigation header, or buttons to dismiss a modal.

## Icons

You can use icons inside buttons. They can stand-alone, or appear before, after,
or on top of the button label. They can also be added before or after the label.

**Note:** If an icon is used in a stand-alone method, an `ariaLabel` must be
present to describe the button.

<Playground>
  <Button type="secondary" icon="user" ariaLabel="I'm a person" />
  <Button label="More" type="secondary" icon="more" />
  <Button
    label="Actions"
    type="secondary"
    icon="arrowDown"
    iconOnRight={true}
  />
</Playground>

## Loading

A way to communicate to the user that a background action is being performed.

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="Deleting..."
    type="primary"
    variation="destructive"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button
    label="Loading..."
    type="tertiary"
    variation="learning"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button label="Canceling..." variation="cancel" loading={true} />
</Playground>

## Client Side Routing

A `Button` can be used for client side routing as well. When using a Button to
handle the client side routing, use the `to` prop. Notice when you click below
that the url will change to the appropriate route.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    return (
      <Router basename="/components/button">
        <Button label="Home" to="/" />
        <Button label="Office" to="/office" />
        <Button label="Dentist" to="/dentist" />
        <hr />
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/">
            This is my home, time to get cozy.
          </Route>
          <Route exact path="/office">
            This is my office, time to get to work.
          </Route>
          <Route exact path="/dentist">
            This is the dentist, time to get my teeth fixed.
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </Router>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Form Submit

Passing the `submit` prop will allow a `Button` to submit a
[Form](/components/form). Since submitting a form is a specific action, only
`variation="work"` and `type="primary"` are allowed.

Since this type of `Button` will only be used to submit a form, it does not make
sense to allow the `external`, `onClick`, `to`, or `url` props.

<Playground>
  <Form onSubmit={() => alert("Wow, what a number")}>
    <Content>
      <InputNumber placeholder="Pick a number" />
      <Button label="Submit" submit={true} />
    </Content>
  </Form>
</Playground>
