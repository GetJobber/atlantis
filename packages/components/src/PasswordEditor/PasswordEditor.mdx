# Password Editor

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

PasswordEditor allows you to gauge and display the strength of a password input
by the user.

```ts
import { PasswordEditor } from "@jobber/components/PasswordEditor";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [[password, secure], setPassword] = useState(["", false]);
    return (
      <>
        <PasswordEditor value={password} onChange={setPassword} />
        <pre>
          {secure ? "✅" : "⚠️"} {password}
        </pre>
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## What are we building?

_And Tests!_

## The starting point

Seed Branch: _TrainingDay_

Take a look…

## The tests are our guide

```
npm test -- packages/components/src/PasswordEditor/PasswordEditor.test.tsx
```

1. `○ skipped renders with custom placeholder`
1. `○ skipped it should call the handler with a new secure value`
1. `○ skipped it should call the handler with a new insecure value`
1. `○ skipped renders an error message when given an insecure value`
1. `○ skipped renders`

## Helpful Commands

- **Starting Atlantis:** `npm start`
- **Running Tests:**
  `npm test -- packages/components/src/PasswordEditor/PasswordEditor.test.tsx`
- **Updating snapshots:**
  `npm test -- -u packages/components/src/PasswordEditor/PasswordEditor.test.tsx`

---

## Note: Relative import within Atlantis

Normally import components _from Atlantis_:

```
  import { Content } from "@jobber/components/Content";
```

While in Atlantis however:

```
  import { Content } from "../Content";
```

We plan to streamline in the future.
