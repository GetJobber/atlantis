# Light Box

LightBox is a component designed to display an array of images to the user. A
user clicks on a control and is shown a carousel style presentation of the
defined images.

This component is a wrapper of the frontend-collective's react-image-lightbox
third party library. This component is a wrapper of the
[frontend-collective's react-image-lightbox](https://github.com/frontend-collective/react-image-lightbox).

```ts
import { LightBox } from "@jobber/components/LightBox";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="LightBox">
    {() => {
      const [open, isOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button label="😈 Click me!" onClick={() => isOpen(true)} />
          <LightBox
            open={open}
            images={[
              {
                title: "😃 Happy Face",
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/6Jcfgnp.jpg",
                caption: "This is a happy face",
              },
              {
                title: "😮",
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/OsLxYkT.jpg",
                caption: "Suprised face",
              },

              },
            ]}
            onRequestClose={() => isOpen(false)}
          />
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Design & usage guidelines

A lightbox's primary goal is to allow users to see a higher resolution view of
images contained within the page they're viewing. The application of a lightbox
facilitates smaller thumbnail images to be used in an interface without
compromising the detail within.

The lightbox should only be used when displaying an image at a greater scale is
the primary function of opening it. Additional content types would be better
suited by using a dialogue or alternative method.

### onRequestClose

This function receives the index of the last image the user viewed before
closing the LightBox component with the key lastPosition. This might we useful
if we want to return information about the final state when closed (e.g. for
analytics).

  <ExampleWithHooks>
    {() => {
      const [open, isOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button label="😈 Click me!" onClick={() => isOpen(true)} />
          <LightBox
            open={open}
            images={[
              {
                title: "😃 Happy Face",
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/6Jcfgnp.jpg",
                caption: "This is a happy face",
              },
              {
                title: "😮",
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/OsLxYkT.jpg",
                caption: "Suprised face",
              },
              {
                url: "https://i.imgur.com/uigfzs5.jpg",
              },
            ]}
            onRequestClose={options => {
              console.log(
                "The user was saw this image last - ",
                options.lastPosition
              );
              isOpen(false);
            }}
          />
        </>
      );
