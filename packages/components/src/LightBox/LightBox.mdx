# Light Box

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

LightBox is a component designed to display an array of images to the user. A
user clicks on a control and is shown a carousel style presentation of the
defined images. This component is a wrapper of the frontend-collective's
react-image-lightbox third party library.

```ts
import { LightBox } from "@jobber/components/LightBox";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [open, isOpen] = useState(false);
    return (
      <>
        <Button label="ðŸ˜ˆ" onClick={() => isOpen(true)} />
        <LightBox
          open={open}
          images={[
            {
              title: "ðŸ˜ƒ",
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/6Jcfgnp.jpg",
              caption: "Happy face"
            },
            {
              title: "ðŸ˜®",
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/OsLxYkT.jpg",
              caption: "Suprised face"
            },
            {
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/uigfzs5.jpg"
            }
          ]}
          onRequestClose={() => isOpen(false)}
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the LightBox component, consider the
following:

- This is a wrapper of a third party library. The underlying library may already
  include the functionality you are looking to add.

## Props

<Props of={LightBox} />

## Images

Images is an array of objects defining a LightBox image. This object consists of
`title`, `caption` and `url`. `title` and `caption` are optional, `url` is
required, for each image.
