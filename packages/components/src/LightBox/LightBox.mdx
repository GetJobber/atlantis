# Light Box

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

LightBox is a component designed to display an array of images to the user. A
user clicks on a control and is shown a carousel style presentation of the
defined images.

This component is a wrapper of the frontend-collective's react-image-lightbox
third party library.

```ts
import { LightBox } from "@jobber/components/LightBox";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [open, isOpen] = useState(false);
    return (
      <>
        <Button label="ðŸ˜ˆ Click me!" onClick={() => isOpen(true)} />
        <LightBox
          open={open}
          images={[
            {
              title: "ðŸ˜ƒ Happy Face",
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/6Jcfgnp.jpg",
              caption: "This is a happy face"
            },
            {
              title: "ðŸ˜®",
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/OsLxYkT.jpg",
              caption: "Suprised face"
            },
            {
              url: "https://i.imgur.com/uigfzs5.jpg"
            }
          ]}
          onRequestClose={() => isOpen(false)}
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

A lightbox should:

- Be used when viewing an image or collection of images is the user's primary
  goal. This shouldn't be used for things like in product upgrade prompts.
- Resemble the industry standard lightbox, using Jobber's font and color
  palette. Novel lightbox functionality will surprise and confuse users.

## Props

<Props of={LightBox} />

---

## open

Specify if the Lightbox is open or closed.

## Images

Images is an array of objects defining a LightBox image. This object consists of
`title`, `caption` and `url`. `title` and `caption` are optional, `url` is
required, for each image.

## Image Index

Use this to specify which image in `images` to initialize the lightbox with.
This is useful when you have a collection of thumbnails as you only need one
collection of image urls, order doesn't matter.

## onRequestClose

This function must set open to false in order to close the lightbox. Note there
is a 300ms easing animation on lightbox close that occurs before this function
is called.
