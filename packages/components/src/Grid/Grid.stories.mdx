# Grid

Helps create a layout that conforms to a 12-point grid system.

```ts
import { Grid } from "@jobber/components/Grid";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid">
    {args => (
      <Grid {...args}>
        <Grid.Cell size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 7, lg: 7, xl: 6 }}>
          <Content>
            <Heading level={1}>Welcome to Atlantis!</Heading>
            <Text size="large">
              Atlantis is a design system for Jobber. The primary objective for
              Atlantis is to provide a system of reusable components to help
              developers to quickly build beautiful and consistent interfaces
              for our users.
            </Text>
          </Content>
        </Grid.Cell>
        <Grid.Cell size={{ xs: 12, sm: 6, md: 5, lg: 5, xl: 6 }}>
          <div style={{ display: "flex", height: "100%" }}>
            <Card>
              <Content>
                <DescriptionList
                  data={[
                    ["Status", "Amazing"],
                    ["Emoji", "ðŸ”±"],
                    ["Components", "A lot!"],
                  ]}
                />
              </Content>
            </Card>
          </div>
        </Grid.Cell>
      </Grid>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Grid} story="Grid" />

## Usage guidelines

The `Grid` is divided up into 12 columns. The `Grid.Cell` child sets how many of
that 12 columns can it take as a width via the sizing prop. The cell also
includes breakpoints of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` on the sizing prop.
Those sizes strictly follow our
[Design Breakpoints](?path=/docs/design-breakpoints--page).

As an example, let's say you have a 3 column grid that goes side by side with a
50/25/25 split on medium-sized screens and up. But, on a small-sized screen, it
stacks on top of each other.

The way you'd achieve that is to:

- Set the `Grid.Cell` child to have a size for `xs` and `md`
  - Like this `{ xs: number, md: number }`
- The `xs` would be set as `12` for all of them so it takes up the whole width
  and automatically stack on extra-small and small screens
- The `md` would then get
  - `6` on Column 1
  - `3` on Column 2
  - `3` on Column 3
- If you sum up the values for `md`, you'd get 12.
  - If you set the last column to be 4, it'll sum up to 13 and pushes that last
    column down.

<Canvas>
  <Grid>
    <Grid.Cell size={{ xs: 12, md: 6 }}>
      <Card>
        <Content>
          <Text>Column 1</Text>
        </Content>
      </Card>
    </Grid.Cell>
    <Grid.Cell size={{ xs: 12, md: 3 }}>
      <Card>
        <Content>
          <Text>Column 2</Text>
        </Content>
      </Card>
    </Grid.Cell>
    <Grid.Cell size={{ xs: 12, md: 3 }}>
      <Card>
        <Content>
          <Text>Column 3</Text>
        </Content>
      </Card>
    </Grid.Cell>
  </Grid>
</Canvas>

## Visualizing the grid lines

If you use a Chromium browser like Google Chrome, Arc, or Safari, you can follow
Chrome's
[Inspect CSS grid layouts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/)
by using the dev tools.
