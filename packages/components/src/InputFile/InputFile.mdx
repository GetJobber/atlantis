# Input File

<ComponentStatus stage="rc" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

`InputFile` allows users to upload a file, or multiple files by dragging and
dropping them into an area on the page or by clicking a button.

```ts
import { InputFile, updateFiles } from "@jobber/components/InputFile";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);
    return (
      <Content>
        <InputFile
          allowMultiple={true}
          getUploadParams={() =>
            Promise.resolve({ url: "https://httpbin.org/post" })
          }
          onUploadStart={handleUpload}
          onUploadProgress={handleUpload}
          onUploadComplete={handleUpload}
        />
        {files.map(file => (
          <FormatFile file={file} />
        ))}
      </Content>
    );
    function handleUpload(file) {
      setFiles(oldFiles => updateFiles(file, oldFiles));
    }
  }}
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the `InputFile` component, consider the
following:

- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.

## Props

<Props of={InputFile} />

## getUploadParams

`getUploadParams` is a necessary callback that tells `InputFile` where and how
to upload files that are passed to it. It must return an object conforming to
the `UploadParams` interface. `getUploadParams` can be async, allowing for a
network request to fetch any extra fields.

```ts
interface UploadParams {
  /**
   * Url to POST file to.
   */
  readonly url: string;

  /**
   * Key to identify file.
   * If unspecified a random `uuid` will be used.
   */
  readonly key?: string;

  /**
   * Any extra fields to send with the upload POST.
   * If unspecified only the file will be included.
   */
  readonly fields?: { [field: string]: string };
}
```

## updateFiles Helper

`InputFile` also exports a `updateFiles` method. This method allows for easily
updating an array of `FileUpload`s based on their `key` as uploads progress.

```ts
/**
 * Upsert a given `FileUpload` into an array of `FileUpload`s.
 * `key` is used to uniquely identify files.
 *
 * @param updatedFile FileUpload File that was updated.
 * @param files Existing array of FileUploads.
 * @returns FileUpload[] updated set of files.
 */
export function updateFiles(updatedFile: FileUpload, files: FileUpload[]);
```

## Only Allow Images

Using the `allowedTypes` prop you can choose to allow all files types or only
images. To upload multiple images you can use the `multiple` prop;

export function fetchUploadParams() {
  return Promise.resolve({ url: "https://httpbin.org/post" });
}

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <InputFile allowedTypes="images" getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams} />
    <InputFile
      allowedTypes="images"
      allowMultiple={true}
      getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams}
    />
  </Content>
</Playground>

## Variations & Size

InputFile supports two variations (`dropzone` & `button`) each with two sizes
(`small` & `base`). Both variations of InputFile allow for drag and drop however
if you have the space `dropzone` is preferred to better indicate this.

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Heading level={2}>Dropzone</Heading>
    <InputFile getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams} />
    <InputFile size="small" getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams} />
    <Heading level={2}>Button</Heading>
    <InputFile variation="button" getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams} />
    <InputFile
      variation="button"
      size="small"
      getUploadParams={fetchUploadParams}
    />
  </Content>
</Playground>
