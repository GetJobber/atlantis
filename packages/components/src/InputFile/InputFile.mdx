# Input File

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Write a description about what InputFile component is trying to achieve.

```ts
import { InputFile, updateFiles } from "@jobber/components/InputFile";
```

export function buildUploadParams(file) {
  return { url: "https://httpbin.org/post", fields: {} };
}

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [files, setFiles] = useState([]);
    return (
      <Content>
        <InputFile
          multiple={true}
          getUploadParams={buildUploadParams}
          onUploadStart={handleUpload}
          onUploadProgress={handleUpload}
          onUploadComplete={handleUpload}
        />
        <ul>
          {files.map(async (fileUpload, index) => (
            <li key={fileUpload.id}>
              {fileUpload.name} â€“ {Math.round(fileUpload.progress * 100)}%
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </Content>
    );
    function handleUpload(file) {
      setFiles(oldFiles => updateFiles(file, oldFiles));
    }
  }}

<!--
  It is not necessary to include Design & Usage Guidlelines. Use this section
  to answer common questions and considerations about component usage.
-->

## Design & Usage Guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the InputFile component, consider the
following:

- When using the InputFile component always consider the volume you would like
  it to be displayed at.
- The InputFile component should never be used inside another component.

## Props

<Props of={InputFile} />

## getUploadParams

`getUploadParams` is a necessary callback that tells `InputFile` where and how
to upload files that are passed to it.

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
-->

## Only Images

Use `loud` to indicate that a component is yelling.

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <InputFile allowedTypes="images" />
    <InputFile allowedTypes="images" multiple={true} />
  </Content>
</Playground>
