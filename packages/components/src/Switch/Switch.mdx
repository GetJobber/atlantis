# Switch

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A switch toggles the state of a single setting to on or off.

```ts
import { Switch } from "@jobber/components/Switch";
```

<Playground>
  <Switch ariaLabel="Visible to clients" />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Switch} />

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The switch is a useful component for manipulating settings with binary
(true/false, yes/no, on/off) conditions. For this reason its' label is limited
to ON/OFF.

### Switches, Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

A switch, a checkbox, and a pair of radio buttons can seem similar in theory, as
all can represent an `either/or decision` for the user. Use a switch when the
user must make a decision to turn something on or off, and a single checkbox
when a user is opting in to a choice. A pair of radio buttons can be used to
help the user decide between two discrete options, such as “fixed price” and
“per visit” invoicing options.

## Controlled Switch

A controlled switch can turn something on or off, and can be controlled by
another UI element on the page. This can useful for two-way interactions where
manipulating another part of the interface should logically drive the same state
change.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [toggleState, setToggleState] = useState(true);
    const label = "Toggle example";
    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => setToggleState(!toggleState)}>{label}</button>
        <br />
        <Switch
          value={toggleState}
          onChange={newToggleState => setToggleState(newToggleState)}
          ariaLabel={label}
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Disabled

A disabled switch cannot be operated by the user. If presenting a disabled "On"
switch to the user, provide a clear description for the user on how to enable
the switch to avoid creating a sense that the user has lost control of the
interface.

<Playground>
  <Switch value={false} ariaLabel="Visible to clients" disabled={true} />
</Playground>
