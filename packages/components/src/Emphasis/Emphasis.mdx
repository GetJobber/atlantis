Use this component to emphasize certain content of a Heading or Text component.
There are variations on Emphasis, each with their own use case and meaning.

```ts
import { Emphasis } from "@jobber/components/Emphasis";
```

<Playground>
  <Text>
    To <Emphasis variation="bold">boldly</Emphasis> go…
  </Text>
</Playground>

## Design & usage guidelines

### Bold

Used to call attention to a piece of text. Bold should indicate that its
contents have
[strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong)

<Playground>
  <Text>
    <Emphasis variation="bold">Save $240</Emphasis> when you choose our Annual
    Plan
  </Text>
</Playground>

### Italic

Italic emphasis should be used when there is stress emphasis on a word (or
words) which modifies the meaning of the sentence itself.

<Playground>
  <Text>
    Simon’s here to show <Emphasis variation="italic">you</Emphasis> how Jobber
    works.
  </Text>
</Playground>

### Highlight

Used to call attention to a specific value prop on a heading. Highlight should
only be used on page titles and subtitle, and is similar in meaning to Bold.

<Playground>
  <Heading level={1}>
    Get paid <Emphasis variation="highlight">faster</Emphasis>
  </Heading>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Emphasis} />
