# Heading

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the
interface. Reserved for short, important text or numbers.

```ts
import { Heading } from "@jobber/components/Heading";
```

<Playground>
  <Heading level={2}>Subtitle</Heading>
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

### Heading 1

This should explain the main subject of the page. There should only be one on a
page.

<Playground>
  <Heading level={1}>New client</Heading>
</Playground>

### Heading 2

Used to categorize large groups of content. For example, there are two main
categories when creating a new client: client details and property details.

This heading can be skipped if there are no large groups that need breaking up.

<Playground>
  <Heading level={2}>Client details</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={2}>Property details</Heading>
  ...
</Playground>

### Heading 3

Used to group content and forms on a single topic.

<Playground>
  <Heading level={3}>Contact details</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={3}>Notifications</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={3}>Additional details</Heading>
  ...
</Playground>

### Heading 4

Used to group contents after a [heading 3](#heading-3) or inside a card
component.

<Playground>
  <Heading level={4}>Phone numbers</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={4}>Email</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={4}>Pigeon</Heading>
  ...
</Playground>

### Heading 5

Used to group contents after a [heading 4](#heading-4).

<Playground>
  <Heading level={5}>Receives SMS</Heading>
</Playground>
