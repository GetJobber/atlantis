# Heading

Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the
interface. Reserved for short, important text or numbers.

```ts
import { Heading } from "@jobber/components/Heading";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Heading" args={{ level: 2 }}>
    {args => {
      return <Heading {...args}>Subtitle</Heading>;
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Heading} story="Heading" />

## Design & usage guidelines

### Heading 1

This should explain the main subject of the page. There should only be one on a
page.

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={1}>New client</Heading>
</Canvas>

### Heading 2

Used to categorize large groups of content. For example, there are two main
categories when creating a new client: client details and property details.

This heading can be skipped if there are no large groups that need breaking up.

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={2}>Client details</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={2}>Property details</Heading>
  ...
</Canvas>

### Heading 3

Used to group content and forms on a single topic.

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={3}>Contact details</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={3}>Notifications</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={3}>Additional details</Heading>
  ...
</Canvas>

### Heading 4

Used to group contents after a [heading 3](#heading-3) or inside a card
component.

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={4}>Phone numbers</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={4}>Email</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={4}>Pigeon</Heading>
  ...
</Canvas>

### Heading 5

Used to group contents after a [heading 4](#heading-4).

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={5}>Receives SMS</Heading>;
</Canvas>

### Heading 6

Used to group contents after a [heading 5](#heading-5) or to group small lists
of content.

<Canvas>
  <Heading level={6}>Business Settings</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={6}>Organization Settings</Heading>
  ...
  <Heading level={6}>Communication Settings</Heading>
  ...
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

The only content that should be used in a `Heading` is text. Use sentence-case
for headings. The exception is `Heading 6`, which is capitalized as a stylistic
reference to the
