# Confirmation Modal

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A ConfirmationModal allows users to confirm or cancel actions that they are
performing. Examples of actions that may need confirmation are navigating off an
edited page or deleting an object.

```ts
import {
  ConfirmationModal,
  confirmationModalReducer
} from "@jobber/components/ConfirmationModal";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
    return (
      <>
        <Button label="Open" onClick={() => setOpen(true)} />
        <ConfirmationModal
          title="Should we?"
          message={`Let's do **something**!`}
          confirmLabel="Do it"
          open={open}
          onConfirm={() => alert("✅")}
          onCancel={() => alert("🙅‍♂️")}
          onRequestClose={() => setOpen(false)}
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Design & Usage Guidelines

ConfirmationModals should be used to confirm or cancel an action the user is
performing.

- Ensure that you are labeling the buttons with appropriate verbs. For example:
  "Are you sure you want to delete" should have a label of "Delete" which is the
  action that will be performed.
- It's good to identify the Object that is being acted upon. For example: "Are
  you sure you want to delete the user: Bub"

## Props

<Props of={ConfirmationModal} />

## Controlled Confirmation Modal

In some instances, such as when dealing with a collection of items with common
actions, you may want to place a single Confirmation Modal on a page and then
call to open it when required for each action.

We can do this by using the `confirmationModalRef` which exposes a `show` method
which allows you to present a confirmation modal on demand.

In the example below we have an array of users and then render a button for each
that presents a confirm modal.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const confirmationModalRef = useRef();
    const users = [
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Bob"
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Donald"
      }
    ];
    return (
      <>
        {users.map(user => {
          return (
            <Button
              label={`Confirm ${user.name}`}
              onClick={() => {
                confirmationModalRef.current.show({
                  title: "Should we?",
                  message: `Hang out with **${user.name}**?`,
                  confirmLabel: "Hangout",
                  onConfirm: () => alert("✅")
                });
              }}
            />
          );
        })}
        <ConfirmationModal ref={confirmationModalRef} />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

- To present non-blocking, contextual, text-only content, use a
  [Tooltip](tooltip).
- To simply present information for users to view, edit, or for a temporary
  change of context, use a regular [Modal](modal).
