# Confirmation Modal

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

<Meta title="Components/ConfirmationModal" component={ConfirmationModal} />

A ConfirmationModal allows users to confirm or cancel actions that they are
performing. Examples of actions that may need confirmation are navigating off an
edited page or deleting an object.

```ts
import {
  ConfirmationModal,
  confirmationModalReducer,
} from "@jobber/components/ConfirmationModal";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="ConfirmationModal">
    {() => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button label="Open" onClick={() => setOpen(true)} />
          <ConfirmationModal
            title="Should we?"
            message={`Let's do **something**!`}
            confirmLabel="Do it"
            open={open}
            onConfirm={() => alert("✅")}
            onCancel={() => alert("🙅‍♂️")}
            onRequestClose={() => setOpen(false)}
          />
        </>
      );
    }}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Design & usage guidelines

ConfirmationModals should be used to confirm or cancel an action the user is
performing.

- Ensure that you are labeling the buttons with appropriate verbs. For example:
  "Are you sure you want to delete" should have a label of "Delete" which is the
  action that will be performed.
- It's good to identify the Object that is being acted upon. For example: "Are
  you sure you want to delete the user: Bub"

## Controlled Confirmation Modal

In some instances, such as when dealing with a collection of items with common
actions, you may want to place a single Confirmation Modal on a page and then
call to open it when required for each action.

We can do this by using the `confirmationModalRef` which exposes a `show` method
which allows you to present a confirmation modal on demand.

In the example below we have an array of users and then render a button for each
that presents a confirm modal.

<Canvas>
  <ExampleWithHooks>
    {() => {
      const confirmationModalRef = useRef();
      const users = [
        {
          id: 1,
          name: "Bob",
        },
        {
          id: 2,
          name: "Donald",
        },
      ];
      return (
        <>
          {users.map(user => {
            return (
              <Button
                label={`Confirm ${user.name}`}
                key={user.id}
                onClick={() => {
                  confirmationModalRef.current.show({
                    title: "Should we?",
                    message: `Hang out with **${user.name}**?`,
                    confirmLabel: "Hangout",
                    onConfirm: () => alert("✅"),
                  });
                }}
              />
            );
          })}
          <ConfirmationModal ref={confirmationModalRef} />
        </>
      );
    }}
  </ExampleWithHooks>
</Canvas>

## Destructive

If the user is confirming an action that will destroy, delete, or remove
something, use a destructive ConfirmationModal to visually reinforce the
potential consequences.

<Canvas>
  <ExampleWithHooks>
    {() => {
      const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
      return (
        <>
          <Button
            label="Delete Bob"
            variation="destructive"
            type="secondary"
            onClick={() => setOpen(true)}
          />
          <ConfirmationModal
            title="Delete Bob?"
            message={`Deleting Bob will remove their data from your account for good.`}
            confirmLabel="Delete Bob"
            open={open}
            onConfirm={() => alert("Bob has been deleted")}
            onCancel={() => alert("Bob will not be deleted")}
            onRequestClose={() => setOpen(false)}
            variation="destructive"
          />
        </>
      );
    }}
  </ExampleWithHooks>
</Canvas>

## Related components

- To present non-blocking, contextual, text-only content, use a
  [Tooltip](tooltip).
- To simply present information for users to view, edit, or for a temporary
  change of context, use a regular [Modal](modal).
