# Description List

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Description Lists are used to display a list of terms and descriptions.

```ts
import { DescriptionList } from "@jobber/components/DescriptionList";
```

<Playground>
  <DescriptionList data={[["Issued", "2018-12-08"], ["Due", "2019-01-06"]]} />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={DescriptionList} />

## Design & Usage Guidelines

The Description List is a great solution when you have a small list of
information with a 1:1 label-to-data relationship. For example, the issued and
due dates on an invoice, or the job type, billing type and duration of a job.

---

## Passing an Element

You are able to pass a react element in as the second term of the data tuple.

<Playground>
  <DescriptionList
    data={[
      ["Issued", <FormatDate date={new CivilDate(2018, 12, 8)} />],
      ["Due", <FormatDate date={new CivilDate(2019, 1, 6)} />]
    ]}
  />
</Playground>
