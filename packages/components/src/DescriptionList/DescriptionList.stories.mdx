# Description List

Description Lists are used to display a list of terms and descriptions.

```ts
import { DescriptionList } from "@jobber/components/DescriptionList";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="DescriptionList">
    {() => (
      <DescriptionList
        data={[
          ["Issued", "2018-12-08"],
          ["Due", "2019-01-06"],
        ]}
      />
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={DescriptionList} story="DescriptionList" />

## Design & usage guidelines

The Description List is a great solution when you have a small list of
information with a 1:1 label-to-data relationship. For example, the issued and
due dates on an invoice, or the job type, billing type and duration of a job.

## Passing a custom element

You are able to pass a react element in as the second term of the data tuple.

<Canvas>
  <DescriptionList
    data={[
      ["Issued", <FormatDate date={new Temporal.PlainDateTime(2018, 12, 8)} />],
      ["Due", <FormatDate date={new Temporal.PlainDateTime(2019, 1, 6)} />],
    ]}
  />
</Canvas>

## Related components

- To list more complex collections of related information, consider using a
  [List](../?path=/docs/components-list--list).
- To display structured data for comparison, consider using a
  [Table](../?path=/docs/components-table--table).
