# Input Email

InputEmail is used to display input with built-in email validation.

```ts
import { InputEmail } from "@jobber/components/InputEmail";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="InputEmail" args={{ placeholder: "Enter your email" }}>
    {args => <InputEmail {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={InputEmail} story="InputEmail" />

## Usage guidelines

Use the `<InputEmail>` when you expect the user to input an email address.

If you are not worried about email address validation, consider using
`InputText`.

## Additional validation

By default, the `InputEmail` will validate email addresses. You can pass in
additional validations as well.

<Canvas>
  <InputEmail
    placeholder="Enter your email"
    validations={{
      required: { value: true, message: "Email address is required" },
    }}
  />
</Canvas>
