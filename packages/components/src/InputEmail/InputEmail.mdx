# Input Email

InputEmail is used to display an input with built in email validation

```ts
import { InputEmail } from "@jobber/components/InputEmail";
```

<Playground>
  <InputEmail placeholder="Enter your email" />
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={InputEmail} />

## Usage Guidelines

Use the `<InputEmail>` when you expect the user to input an email address.

If you are not worried about email address validation, consider using
`InputText`.

## Additional validation

By default the `InputEmail` will validate email addresses. You can pass in
additional validations as well.

<Playground>
  <InputEmail
    placeholder="Enter your email"
    validations={{
      required: { value: true, message: "Email address is required" },
    }}
  />
</Playground>
