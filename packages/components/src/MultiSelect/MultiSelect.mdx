# Multi Select

The `MultiSelect` component gives our users the possibility to select multiple
options from a menu.

```ts
import { MultiSelect } from "@jobber/components/MultiSelect";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [options, setOptions] = useState([
      { label: "Synced", checked: true },
      { label: "Errors" },
      { label: "Warnings", checked: true },
      { label: "Ignored", checked: true },
    ]);
    const handleChange = clickedOption => {
      setOptions(current =>
        current.map(option => {
          if (option.label == clickedOption.label) {
            return { ...option, checked: !clickedOption.checked };
          }
          return option;
        })
      );
    };
    return (
      <MultiSelect
        defaultLabel="Status"
        allSelectedLabel="All Statuses"
        options={options}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
    );
  }}
</Playground>

<!--
  INTERFACE: This is for the proposal stage of the component

  Provide an example of what the component looks like in code. How would you use
  it from another React component? This should consist primarily of code blocks.
  This section can be deleted once the component is built, when the Playground
  will demonstrate this at a higher fidelity.
-->

## Props

<Props of={MultiSelect} />

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
-->

## Usage Guidelines

The goal of the `MultiSelect` component is to allow a user to check multiple
options within a list of items.

A user can click on the element to expand it and display the multiple options.
The element will display the selected options or the placeholder text if none
are selected.

Every time an option is checked or unchecked a behavior can be triggered using
the onChange prop

<!--
  What is the design purpose of this component? How do its responsibilities
  relate to other components? What should this component not be used for? What
  are some related components in Atlantis? Try to describe this component not
  in terms of what it looks like or what elements make it up, but what function
  it performs or how it enables a user to perform tasks (e.g. “Buttons allow users
  to initiate, complete, and reverse actions.” vs “Buttons are rectangular elements
  that have a green background and white text”).
-->

## Accessibility

- Users should be able to use their keyboard to navigate through the options and
  check/uncheck them
- The trigger contains a downward-pointing-arrow to hint that it can be
  expanded.

## Responsiveness

On mobile devices the interaction behaviour would be the same as a mouse with
touch/click. The component should adapt to different screen sizes the same as an
html select would.

<!--
  How should the component behave on an iPhone 8? An iPad? A 1920x1080 monitor? How does the
  component appear when the component itself is less than 375px wide? Less than 640px wide?
  Less than 1200px wide? Greater than 1200px? Does it change when the device DPI is higher
  or lower?

<!--
  Insert a Figma mockup from the [Design System Contribution template](https://www.figma.com/file/3BXCXXD9glMtj8RAHjXiQC/Design-System-Contribution-TEMPLATE?node-id=26%3A2)
  that conveys the visual design of the component, with variants and state accounted for.
  Consider progressive enhancement; might this rely on newer browser features that aren’t
  widely supported yet?
