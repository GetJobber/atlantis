# Multi Select

The `MultiSelect` component gives our users the possibility to select multiple
options from a menu.

```ts
import { MultiSelect } from "@jobber/components/MultiSelect";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [options, setOptions] = useState([
      { label: "Synced", checked: true },
      { label: "Errors", checked: false },
      { label: "Warnings", checked: true },
      { label: "Ignored", checked: true },
    ]);
    return (
      <MultiSelect
        defaultLabel="Status"
        allSelectedLabel="All Statuses"
        options={options}
        onOptionsChange={setOptions}
      />
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={MultiSelect} />

## Usage Guidelines

The goal of the `MultiSelect` component is to allow a user to check multiple
options within a list of items.

A user can click on the element to expand it and display the multiple options.
The element will display the selected options or the placeholder text if none
are selected.

Every time an option is checked or unchecked a behavior can be triggered using
the onOptionsChange prop

### Sizes

Adjusting the size of the `MultiSelect` can be used to help align with common
adjacent elements such as `InputText` or `Select`.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [options, setOptions] = useState([
      { label: "Small", checked: false },
      { label: "Large", checked: false },
    ]);
    return (
      <>
        <MultiSelect
          defaultLabel="Small"
          allSelectedLabel="All Selected"
          options={options}
          onOptionsChange={setOptions}
          size="small"
        />
        <Divider size="largest" />
        <MultiSelect
          defaultLabel="Large"
          allSelectedLabel="All selected"
          options={options}
          onOptionsChange={setOptions}
          size="large"
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Accessibility

- The MultiSelect trigger element contains a downward-pointing-arrow to hint
  that it can be expanded;
- Users are able to focus the MultiSelect trigger element by using the Tab key;
- Users should be able to display the options by using the Space or Enter/Return
  keys;
- Users should be able to navigate through the options by using Tab or
  ArrowDown/ArrowUp keys and check/uncheck them by using Space or Enter/Return
  keys;
- Users can press the Escape key, click out of the component or click the
  trigger again to close the menu;
- Features and behavior are announced to the user when using a screen reader;

## Responsiveness

On mobile devices the interaction behaviour would be the same as a mouse with
touch/click. The component should adapt to different screen sizes the same as an
html select would.
