<!--
  INTERFACE: This is for the proposal stage of the component

  Provide an example of what the component looks like in code. How would you use
  it from another React component? This should consist primarily of code blocks.
  This section can be deleted once the component is built, when the Playground
  will demonstrate this at a higher fidelity.
-->

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Link} story="Link" />

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
-->

## Usage guidelines

The `<Link>` will render an `<a>` tag with the appropriate `href`, `rel` and
`target` attributes, and included appropriate iconography for external links.

A `<Link>` marked external will always open in a new tab. Set this when linking
away from Jobber or to other applications or sites across Jobber where this
behaviour is appropriate (e.g. linking from Jobber Online to the Jobber Help
Center).

`<Link>` should not be used to submit form data, trigger actions, or alter the
state of the page. Use a `<Button>` for these purposes.

<!--
  What is the design purpose of this component? How do its responsibilities
  relate to other components? What should this component not be used for? What
  are some related components in Atlantis? Try to describe this component not
  in terms of what it looks like or what elements make it up, but what function
  it performs or how it enables a user to perform tasks (e.g. “Buttons allow users
  to initiate, complete, and reverse actions.” vs “Buttons are rectangular elements
  that have a green background and white text”).
-->

## Content guidelines

Contents of the link should be textual, and may include some formatting features
(e.g. italic text for emphasis may be appropriate, changing the inherited
underline probably isn't). The text can be plain, from a `Typography` component,
a `format`(`Date|Time|Email`) component or similar. Don't use this component to
wrap other kinds of UI elements to make them clickable.

<!--
  What type of content does this component present (documents, text, images, other components)?
  What is the recommended, or expected, amount of content? What is the components’ behaviour when
  the provided content diverges from what is expected (image aspect ratio, amount of text, video
  vs audio, filesize)? Are there any important references to the [Product Vocabulary](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/guides/product-vocabulary)
  that should be made regarding this component? What happens when content is unavailable or unreliable
  (poor connection, empty states, flaky GPS data?)
-->

## Accessibility

Try to ensure the text of the `<Link>` is descriptive of the destination. Avoid
using "click here" or "learn more" as the text of the link, and instead use the
title of the destination page or a short description of the content.

If it's not possible to make the visible text sufficiently descriptive without
additional context, set the `ariaLabel` prop to a descriptive string for
screenreaders. Do _not_ set this prop if it will be redundant to the link text.

<!--
  Describe the accessibility concerns for the component. How does it handle touch vs cursor vs
  keyboard events? Should it capture input? What should a screen reader see when it's focuse?
-->

## Notes

Current behaviour is limited to internally written links within the product and
not rendering links in user provided content. Additional props and behaviour
would be important to use this with user generated content and set appropriate
values for `rel` and `referrerpolicy`.

<!--
  What decisions worth remembering have gone into this component? Did we consider any potentially valuable
  functionality that we’re not implementing right now for scope purposes? Are there any design decisions
  that might need explaining beyond the usage guidelines? This will help consumers understand this component
  more fully.
