# Chips

Chips are a flexible component that can be used for selection of items from a
group while preserving vertical space in the interface.

```ts
import { Chip, Chips } from "../Chips";
```

## Usage Guidelines

The `<Chip>` will allow users to make selections in scenarios where vertical
space is at a premium. It has three high-level usages: single-select,
multi-select, and add/dismiss selection.

### Single-select

If you need the user to make a selection of a single item from amongst several
items, and those items all have short (1–2 word) labels, a single-select Chips
will allow the user to choose one of those items.

This preserves vertical space while allowing the user to clearly identify which
item they have selected.

Unlike [Radio](/components/radio-group), the selected single-select Chip can be
de-selected by the user, leaving all selections blank.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [selected, setSelected] = useState();
    return (
      <Content>
        <Text>
          You are <u>{selected ? selected : "_______"}</u>
        </Text>
        <Chips selected={selected} onChange={setSelected}>
          <Chip
            prefix={<Avatar initials="AZ" />}
            label="Amazing"
            value="Amazing"
          />
          <Chip
            prefix={<Icon name="video" />}
            label="Wonderful"
            value="Wonderful"
          />
          <Chip
            prefix={<Icon name="starFill" />}
            label="Brilliant"
            value="Brilliant"
          />
          <Chip label="Magnificent" value="Magnificent" />
        </Chips>
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

### Multi-select

If you need the user to make a selection of one _or more_ items from amongst
several items, and those items all have short (1–2 word) labels, a multi-select
Chips will allow the user to choose as many items from the group as they wish.

This preserves vertical space while allowing the user to clearly identify which
items they have selected. To signify to the user that multiple selections are
possible, a checkmark icon is present to reinforce the conceptual similarity to
a [Checkbox](/components/checkbox).

Similar to Checkbox, a selected multi-select Chip can be de-selected by the
user, leaving all selections blank.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [selected, setSelected] = useState([]);
    return (
      <Content>
        <Text>
          You are <u>{selected.length ? selected.join(" ") : "_______"}</u>
        </Text>
        <Chips type="multiselect" selected={selected} onChange={setSelected}>
          <Chip
            prefix={<Avatar initials="AZ" />}
            label="Amazing"
            value="Amazing"
          />
          <Chip
            prefix={<Icon name="video" />}
            label="Wonderful"
            value="Wonderful"
          />
          <Chip
            prefix={<Icon name="starFill" />}
            label="Brilliant"
            value="Brilliant"
          />
          <Chip label="Magnificent" value="Magnificent" />
        </Chips>
      </Content>
    );
  }}
</Playground>

<!-- TODO: Uncomment once dismissible is implemented -->

<!-- ### Add/dismiss selection

When the user will be selecting one or more items by inputting their own Chip
options with, use the dismissible Chip.

The dismissible Chip allows them to remove previous
selections from the Chips. Use this option when the full list of possible
selections is too great to reasonably display in one group of Chip. For example,
"all of my phone contacts" would be far too many Chip options to present in one
group, and would be overwhelming for the user to interpret.

This format also allows the user to create their own "freeform" Chip options,
which they can also remove once added.

 -->

### Dismissible Chip

A standalone chip that gives you an action to remove it from a list.

```ts
import { ChipDismissible } from "../Chips";
```

<Playground>
  <ChipDismissible
    prefix={<Avatar initials="MB" />}
    label="Mercedes-Benz"
    onClick={() => alert("chip")}
    onRequestRemove={() => alert("remove")}
  />{" "}
  <ChipDismissible
    prefix={<Icon name="engine" color="yellow" />}
    label="Check engine light"
    onRequestRemove={() => alert("remove")}
  />{" "}
  <ChipDismissible label="Black" onRequestRemove={() => alert("remove")} />
</Playground>

## Content Guidelines

Chip labels should be 1–2 words at most. If any of the options in the group may
have longer labels, consider Checkbox or Radio as necessary for your selection
type.

## Accessibility

Chips should convey to the user whether it is a "checkbox" or "radio" element
based on single or multi-select. The Chips in this group have the appropriate
roles and keyboard operation to allow the user to interact as though they are
dealing with a checkbox or radio button.

If Chips is set for add/dimiss selections, the dismiss button will notify the
user that they will "dismiss {label name}" upon press.

## Responsiveness

The Chips itself will take up as much space as its' container allows, and the
Chips will flow left-to-right. Chips may re-flow into new rows, or scroll out of
view in a single row, depending on your use case.

## Related Components

- [Radio](/components/radio-group) should be used to allow the user to select
  "one-of-many" items (single-select) and the labels for the items are longer
  than 1 or 2 words.
- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox) should be used to allow the user to select
  "one-or-more-of-many" items (multi-select) and the labels for the items are
  longer than 1 or 2 words.
- [InlineLabel](/components/inline-label) should be used when you just need a
  rectangular element that displays the status of another element.

## Notes

There was some consideration to bring the ability to "accent" Chips with certain
colors for parity with Jobber's mobile platform, but we will not be implementing
this for the web components as of this first iteration of our web Chip. The
mobile use-case is very specific to a filtering use case that we as of now do
not anticipate will be required for web.
