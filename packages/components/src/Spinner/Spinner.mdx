## Design & usage guidelines

Use Spinner to indicate loading of content where the actual amount of loading
time or progress is unknown.

### Small

The `small` spinner should be used on individual element of an interface (ie.
button or card contents) or when inline with content

<Playground>
  <Spinner size="small" />
</Playground>

### Inline

Use `inline` to render the spinner inline with content, such as when it has a
leading piece of text content that adds context to what loading is happening.

<Playground>
  <Text>
    Uploading... <Spinner size="small" inline={true} />
  </Text>
</Playground>

## Accessibility

The `Spinner` should announce itself to users of assistive technology such as
screenreaders.

The following built-in properties help `Spinner` convey its' role effectively:

- `role="alert"` allows the `Spinner` to be announced as an alert feedback
  element
- `aria-busy={true}` informs the user that the view is busy, setting the
  expectation that they cannot interact for the time being
- `aria-label="loading"` reads out "Loading" to assistive tech, adding context
  as to _why_ the view is busy

If the amount of progress or loading time is known, use
[ProgressBar](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/progress-bar) to give
the user better context around the process.
