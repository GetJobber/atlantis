# Tabs

Tabs are used to alternate amongst related views within the same context.

```ts
import { Tabs, Tab } from "@jobber/components/Tabs";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Tabs">
    {() => {
      return (
        <Tabs>
          <Tab label="Eggs">
            üç≥ Some eggs are laid by female animals of many different species,
            including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have
            been eaten by humans for thousands of years.
          </Tab>
          <Tab label="Cheese">
            üßÄ Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a
            wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the
            milk protein casein.
          </Tab>
          <Tab label="Berries">
            üçì A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit. Typically,
            berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet, sour or tart,
            and do not have a stone or pit.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Tabs when you need to group related sub-groups of content and the user only
needs to access one sub-group at a time.

Do not use Tabs as a means of navigating the view or in lieu of a Table of
Contents.

## Related components

To show multiple groupings of content at once, use
[Card](/docs/components-card--card).

To allow the user to select one-of-many options in a form, use
[RadioGroup](/docs/components-radiogroup--radio-group) or
[Select](/docs/components-select--select).

## Accessibility

Tabs have known accessibility concerns, including:

- the user cannot navigate between Tabs using the arrow keys
  - this breaks a universal expectation for tabbed interfaces
- the user cannot keyboard-navigate directly from the selected Tab into the
  selected Tab content
  - initial keypress of `tab` key or `command+option+right` focuses next Tab
