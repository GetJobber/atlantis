# Tabs

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Tabs are used to alternate amongst related views within the same context.

```ts
import { Tabs, Tab } from "@jobber/components/Tabs";
```

<Playground>
  <Tabs>
    <Tab label="Eggs">
      üç≥ Some eggs are laid by female animals of many different species,
      including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been
      eaten by humans for thousands of years.

    <Tab label="Cheese">
      üßÄ Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide
      range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein
      casein.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Berries">
      üçì A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit. Typically, berries

## Design & Usage Guidelines

Use Tabs when you need to group related sub-groups of content and the user only
needs to access one sub-group at a time.

Do not use Tabs as a means of navigating the view or in lieu of a Table of
Contents.

## Related Components

To show multiple groupings of content at once, use [Card](card).

To allow the user to select one-of-many options in a form, use
[RadioGroup](radio-group) or [Select](select).

## Accessibility

Tabs have known accessibility concerns, including:

- the user cannot navigate between Tabs using the arrow keys
  - this breaks a universal expectation for tabbed interfaces
- the user cannot keyboard-navigate directly from the selected Tab into the
  selected Tab content
  - initial keypress of `tab` key or `command+option+right` focuses next Tab
