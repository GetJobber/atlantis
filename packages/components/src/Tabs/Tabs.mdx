context.

## Simple Example

import { Tabs, Tab } from "@jobber/components/Tabs";
```

<Playground>

    <Tab label="Eggs" onClick={() => alert("I had eggs for breakfast.")}>
      üç≥ Some eggs are laid by female animals of many different species,
      including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been
      eaten by humans for thousands of years.
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Cheese">
      üßÄ Cheese is a dairy product derived from milk that is produced in a wide
      range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein
      casein.
