# TimePicker

<ComponentStatus stage="pre" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

In Jobber a TimePicker is used to select a time of day. For example the time a
messages should be sent or when a job started/ended.

At the moment the 12-hour vs 24-hour preference is set by the operating system
and this component doesn't look at the Jobber setting.

## Simple Example

<Playground>

  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(2,35)} size="small" />
  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(2,35)} />
  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(2,35)} size="large" />

</Playground>

## States

<Playground>

  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(3, 52)} disabled />
  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(5, 23)} readOnly />
  <TimePicker defaultValue={new CivilTime(2, 35)} invalid />

</Playground>

## Events

If the input starts empty the `ChangeEvent` isn't fired until a full time is
set. Setting just the hour or minute or _meridiam_ won't fire the event. When
the last element is set the change event will fire.

<Playground>

<TimePicker onChange={x => console.log(x)} />

</Playground>

## TimePicker Properties

<Props of={TimePicker} />
