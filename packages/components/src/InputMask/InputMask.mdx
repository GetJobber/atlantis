# Input Mask

```ts
import { InputMask } from "@jobber/components/InputMask";
```

<Playground>
  <InputMask text="Bob" />
</Playground>

<!--
  INTERFACE: This is for the proposal stage of the component

  Provide an example of what the component looks like in code. How would you use
  it from another React component? This should consist primarily of code blocks.
  This section can be deleted once the component is built, when the Playground
  will demonstrate this at a higher fidelity.
-->

## Props

<Props of={InputMask} />

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
