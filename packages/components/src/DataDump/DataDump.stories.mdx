# Data Dump

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

The `DataDump` component is used when developing to nicely format data for
debugging purposes.

```ts
import { DataDump } from "@jobber/components/DataDump";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="DataDump"
    args={{
      data: {
        name: "Bob",
      },
    }}
  >
    {args => <DataDump {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
