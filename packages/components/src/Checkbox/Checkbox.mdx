# Checkbox

A checkbox lets a user select one or more items from a set of options.

```ts
import { Checkbox } from "@jobber/components/Checkbox";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [checked, setChecked] = useState(true);
    return (
      <Checkbox
        checked={checked}
        label="Save card for future use"
        onChange={setChecked}
      />
    );
  }}
</Playground>

## Usage Guidelines

A checkbox is a familiar pattern for users who need to choose from a set of
options, or opt in to a single choice.

A single checkbox, a [Switch](switch), and a pair of
[radio buttons](radio-group) can seem similar in theory, as all can represent an
either/or decision for the user. Use a switch when the user must make a decision
to turn something on or off, and a single checkbox when a user is opting in to a
choice. A pair of radio buttons can be used to help the user decide between two
discrete options, such as “fixed price” and “per visit” invoicing options.

## Props

<Props of={Checkbox} />

## Indeterminate

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [items, setItems] = useState([true, false, false]);
    return (
      <>
        <Checkbox
          label="Select All"
          checked={!items.includes(false)}
          onChange={toggleAll}
          indeterminate={items.includes(false) && items.includes(true)}
        />
        <ul>
          {items.map((value, index) => (
            <li key={index}>
              <Checkbox
                label={`Item ${index}`}
                checked={value}
                onChange={toggleIndex(index)}
              />
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </>
    );
    function toggleIndex(index) {
      return newValue => {
        const updatedItems = Array.from(items);
        updatedItems[index] = newValue;
        setItems(updatedItems);
      };
    }
    function toggleAll(newValue) {
      setItems(Array(items.length).fill(newValue));
    }
  }}
</Playground>

## With a description

If there is more information needed for a `Checkbox`, use the `description` prop
instead of a longer `label`.

<Playground>
  <Checkbox
    label="Save card for future use"
    description="If you save your card now, you'll never need to save it again."
  />
</Playground>

## Disabled

A disabled checkbox cannot be operated by the user. Your primary goal should be
to avoid disabled states in an interface, but some cases may require that an
element be disabled.

If presenting a disabled "checked" checkbox to the user, provide a clear
description for the user on how to enable the checkbox to avoid creating a sense
that the user has lost control of the interface.

<Playground>
  <Checkbox
    disabled={true}
    defaultChecked={true}
    label="Subscribe on marketing emails"
  />
</Playground>

## Related components

- To let people turn a setting on or off instantly, use a [Switch](switch).
- To present a set of options where people can only make a single choice, use a
  [Radio Group](radio-group).
