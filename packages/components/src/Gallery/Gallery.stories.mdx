## Props

<ArgsTable of={Gallery} story="Gallery" />

## Usage guidelines

The `<Gallery>` will layout a set of thumbnails as a group and allows the user
to tap/click to see them larger

### Sizes

The Gallery will set the size of the thumbnails it displays to "default" if a
size isn't explicitly set, and can also set the size to "large"

<Canvas>
  <Gallery size="large" files={files} />
</Canvas>

### Max

The Gallery can be constrained to only show a maximum number of thumbnails, and
provide the user with a button to display the rest of the thumbnails beyond the
maximum

<Canvas>
  <Gallery max={2} files={files} />
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

The Gallery was created to present images, specifically thumbnails, to the user.
The Gallery can display as many images as the designs call for, but if the
amount of images becomes too great, the `max` prop can be used to constrain the
number of images shown.

## Accessibility

Each of the thumbnails the Gallery displays are tab navigatable. A hover state
will also slightly dim a particular thumbnail when the cursor hovers over it.

## Responsiveness

Responsiveness of thumbnails are controlled by the Gallery wrapper, thumbnails
do not get resized. In other words, if the device rendering the Gallery is 500px
wide, then taking into account padding it will display roughly three thumbnails
beside each other before wrapping subsequent thumbnails to a new line
