# useAssert

During development, disrupt the render of a component when a conditional is met.
This is helpful when you want to limit something that Typescript can't do...
yet.

```ts
import { useAssert } from "../hooks/useAssert";
```

```ts
const child: ReactElement = <Avatar initials="JBR" />;
// Make sure the child can only be an <Icon /> component
useAssert(child.type !== Icon, "You can only pass in an <Icon /> child");
```

## Warn

If you still want to assert but doesn't want to disrupt the render, you can pass
in a `warn: true` param. This will throw a warning on your browser console.

```ts
const url: string = "http://getjobber.com";
// Make sure the url always starts with https://
useAssert(url.startsWith("http://"), "Please pass in an `https://` url", {
  warn: true,
});
```
