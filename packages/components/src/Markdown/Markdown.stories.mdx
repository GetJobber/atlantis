# Markdown

Markdown component is a text-to-HTML conversion tool with a twist! Because,
instead of using semantic HTML tags, it uses our own atlantis component for
paragraph, bold, italic, and heading.

```ts
import { Markdown } from "@jobber/components/Markdown";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Markdown"
    args={{
      content: `### Bananas
Bananas are **yellow** on the outside and **white** on the inside. They're also full of nutrients, _but thats just boring stuff_. At this point, I'll just ask you to [google it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=types+of+bananas).`,
      externalLink: true,
    }}
  >
    {args => <Markdown {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Markdown} story="Markdown" />
