# Markdown

<ComponentStatus stage="rc" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

Markdown component is a text-to-HTML conversion tool with a twist! Because,
instead of using semantic HTML tags, it uses our own atlantis component for
paragraph, bold, italic, and heading.

  <Markdown content={`### Bananas

    Bananas are **yellow** on the outside and **white** on the inside. It's also full of nutrients, _but thats just boring stuff_. At this point, I'll just ask you to [google it](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=types+of+bananas).`} />
