# Toast

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="no" accessible="no" />

Toasts are short, temporary messages used to inform users that a process was
performed. They provide visual feedback on the outcome of an action, and require
minimal user interacction.

Toast, unlike common React components is not a component that will be added to
your view. Instead, Toast is used by importing and calling the `showToast()`
function.

```ts
import { showToast } from "@jobber/components/Toast";
```

<Playground>
  <Button
    label="show toast"
    onClick={() =>
      showToast({
        message: "Toast has been toasted",
      })
    }
  />
</Playground>

## Design & usage guidelines

When contributing to or consuming the Toast component, consider the following:

- Keep text labels as short as possible. They should be clear and concise, and
  should not take up more than one line.
- Use the pattern: noun + verb.
  - Examples: `Job saved`, `Quote approved`, `Client archived`.
- No need to use "Successfully", should be implicit in the toast.
- Don't use `Dismiss` or `Cancel` as an action label.
  - Examples of action labels: `Undo`, `View`, `Refresh`.

## Related components

For more persistent feedback (such as displaying errors), communicating a
background process that is ongoing, or for feedback that has a longer reading
length or CTA, use [Banner.](banner)

### Errors

> Do not use Toast for errors. This is currently an available variation, but
> should be considered deprecated and not propagated.

Use [Banner](banner) and, where necessary, targeted error messaging (such as
[InputValidation](input-validation)) so that the user can appropriately assess
and recover from the error.

## Props

<Props of={Toast} />

## Variations

The primary use case for Toast is success messages.

In some cases, an informational Toast may be used to inform the user of some
background system activity.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    return (
      <>
        <Button
          label="Info Toast"
          variation="learning"
          onClick={() =>
            showToast({
              message: "Toasting is underway",
              variation: "info",
            })
          }
        />
        <Button
          label="Success Toast"
          onClick={() =>
            showToast({
              message: "Toast is ready",
              variation: "success",
            })
          }
        />
      </>
    );
  }}
</Playground>
