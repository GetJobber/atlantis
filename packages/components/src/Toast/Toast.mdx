<Playground>
  {() => {
    const toastRef = useRef();
    return (
      <>
        <Button
          label={`Cook Bread`}
          onClick={() => {
            toastRef.current.add({

<!--
  It is not necessary to include Design & Usage Guidlelines. Use this section
  to answer common questions and considerations about component usage.
-->

## Design & Usage Guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the Toast component, consider the following:

- When using the Toast component always consider the volume you would like it to
  be displayed at.
- The Toast component should never be used inside another component.

## Props

<Props of={Toast} />

<!--
  It is not necessary to provide an example of each prop. Use usage examples to
  highlight key features of a component or particular considerations.

  See `Button.mdx` for a good example of this.
-->

## Loud

Use `loud` to indicate that a component is yelling.

<Playground>
  <Toast text="Fred" loud={true} />
</Playground>
