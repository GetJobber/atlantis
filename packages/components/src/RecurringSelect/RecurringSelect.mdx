# RecurringSelect

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A `RecurringSelect` is used to provide an intuitive, accessible pre-built UI
allowing a user to build a custom schedule using a handful of different time
intervals.

While it can be used in isolation, most often makes sense to include it as part
of a more complex scheduling component that can use the returned data as part of
a complete schedule.

```ts
import { RecurringSelect } from "@jobber/components/RecurringSelect";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [rule, setRule] = useState({ interval: 1, type: DurationPeriod.Day });
    return <RecurringSelect value={rule} disabled={false} onChange={setRule} />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={RecurringSelect} />

## Design and usage guidelines

The RecurringSelect is a complex tool, so ensure the user will require the full suite of 
recurrence options before reaching for it. For instances where you may only require 
a simple recurrence option, such as "Every `n` weeks", you are likely better served using basic
form inputs such as `InputNumber` or `Select` to give the user fewer options.

The visual calendar selections in the RecurringSelect will scale up or down to adapt to the 
width of the RecurringSelect's container, allowing this pattern to be more prominent when used as a 
primary interface, or work in a smaller column-based or mobile interface. Consider this as you
design solutions that may require RecurringSelect.

### Disabled state

When the RecurringSelect is set to disabled, all child components become disabled. As with
any design, your first goal should be to _avoid_ creating a flow where the user 
encounters a disabled state, so only use this approach if a disabled state cannot be avoided.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [rule, setRule] = useState({
      interval: 1,
      type: DurationPeriod.DayOfMonth,
      date: new Set([2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 18, 25, "LAST"]),
    });
    return <RecurringSelect value={rule} disabled={true} onChange={setRule} />;
  }}
</Playground>

## Accessibility

The `RecurringSelect` component is entirely usable by keyboard.

All selections can be done and undone with tabs, arrows and the space bar. The "visual" 
calendar-style selectors are all built using radio or checkbox elements where necessary,
ensuring that users of assistive tech have appropriate context as to the type of
selection they are making.

## Related Components

To allow the user to select specific dates, use [Datepicker](/components/date-picker) or [InputDate](/components/input-date).
