# RecurringSelect

<ComponentStatus stage="ready" responsive="yes" accessible="yes" />

A `RecurringSelect` is used to provide an intuitive, accessible pre-built UI
allowing a user to build a custom schedule using a handful of different time
intervals.

While it can be used in isolation, most often makes sense to include it as part
of a more complex scheduling component that can use the returned data as part of
a complete schedule.

```ts
import { RecurringSelect } from "@jobber/components/RecurringSelect";
```

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const [schedulerState, setSchedulerState] = useScheduler({
      recurrence: {
        rule: { interval: 1, type: DurationPeriod.Day },
      },
    });
    const onChangeSchedule = (partialNextSchedule) => {
      setSchedulerState({ ...schedulerState, ...partialNextSchedule });
    }
    return(
      <RecurringSelect
        recurrenceRule={schedulerState.recurrence.rule}
        disabled={false}
        onChange={onChangeSchedule}
      />);
    }}

</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={RecurringSelect} />

## Accessibility

The `RecurringSelect` component is entirely usable by keyboard.

All selections can be done and undone with tabs, arrows and the space bar.
