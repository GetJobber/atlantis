# Typography

When a designer is talking about "type", it's unlikely they're asking about the
latest Typescript linting rules! Typography is a core aspect of any user
interface, and we've built a system that should make it simple for our
interfaces to be built with consistent, considered typographic elements.

The Atlantis typography system is based on the core components of
[Heading](/packages-components-src-heading-heading) and
[Text](/packages-components-src-text-text).

<Playground>
  <Heading>
    A <Emphasis variation="highlight">prominent</Emphasis> heading
  </Heading>
  <Text>
    A longer body of text that's better suited for readabilty at smaller sizes.
    Typically a paragraph should be displayed in a typeface that has a moderate
    weight, and is <Emphasis variation="italic">relatively</Emphasis> free of
    flourish.
  </Text>
</Playground>

Heading and Text are extended by the ability to add
[Emphasis](/packages-components-src-emphasis-emphasis) to these components as
needed.

There are some foundational elements that make up these components:

## Font families

### Display

[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) is our display face across
all of Jobber's platforms. It has a heft that makes it especially well-suited
for high-level headings, and its' association with our brand makes it effective
for labeling our [Buttons](/components/button).

### Base

[Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) is our most
broadly-used typeface. It is used for body copy, most headings, data display,
form inputs, labels, and more!

## Font sizes

Our base font-size is based on our [Spacing](/space) scale for a consistent
sizing rhythm across Jobber. At its' default zoom level, the equivalent is
`16px`. While this is higher than in some systems where `14` may be more common,
Source Sans Pro is optically a bit smaller, particularly at the x-height, so we
start with `16` and work our way up and down from there.

## Line height

Line height, or
[leading](https://www.shillingtoneducation.com/blog/leading-typography/), is the
space between subsequent lines of type.

Our base line-height of `1.25` is optimized for reading multiple lines of
`Text`. From the base, we have options for tighter or larger line-heights that
will vary as you move up and down the size scale.

As our `Headings` get larger, we reduce our line-height as...

- the user is unlikely to be reading multiple lines of a level 1 `Heading`
- the larger font-sizes of Poppins at that scale are easier to read and do not
  require as much line-to-line distinction
