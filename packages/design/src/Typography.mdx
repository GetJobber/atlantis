# Typography

When a designer is talking about "type", it's unlikely they're asking about the
latest Typescript linting rules! Typography is a core aspect of any user
interface, and we've built a system that should make it simple for our
interfaces to be built with consistent, considered typographic elements.

The Atlantis typography system is based on the core components of
[Heading](/packages-components-src-heading-heading) and
[Text](/packages-components-src-text-text).

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Heading level={1}>
      A <Emphasis variation="highlight">prominent</Emphasis> heading
    </Heading>
    <Text>
      A longer body of text that's better suited for readabilty at smaller
      sizes. Typically a paragraph should be displayed in a typeface that has a
      moderate weight, and is <Emphasis variation="italic">relatively</Emphasis>{" "}
      free of flourish.
    </Text>
  </Content>
</Playground>

Heading and Text are extended by the ability to add
[Emphasis](/packages-components-src-emphasis-emphasis) to these components as
needed.

There are some foundational elements that make up these components:

## Font families

### Display

[Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) is our display face across
all of Jobber's platforms. It has a heft that makes it especially well-suited
for high-level headings, and its' association with our brand makes it effective
for labeling our [Buttons](/components/button).

<Playground>
  <Content>
    <Heading level={2}>Poppins is used for bold statements</Heading>
    <Button label="And punchy labels"></Button>
  </Content>
</Playground>

### Base

[Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) is our most
broadly-used typeface. It is used for body copy, most headings, data display,
form inputs, labels, and more!

<Playground>
  <Content spacing="large">
    <Heading level={3}>Source Sans Pro is for less prominent headings</Heading>
    <Text>
      You can also use it for longer, more readable statements in paragraphs,
      descriptive text, in lists, and more. If you've been paying careful
      attention, you might have noticed that Atlantis even uses Source Sans Pro
      for presenting documentation!
    </Text>
    <Checkbox
      checked
      label="Source Sans Pro can label inputs nicely"
    ></Checkbox>
    <InputText
      defaultValue="It's great for input values too"
      placeholder="Source Sans Pro for labels"
    />
    <Table>
      <Header>
        <Cell>Source</Cell>
        <Cell>Sans</Cell>
        <Cell align="right">Pro</Cell>
      </Header>
      <Row>
        <Cell>Data point</Cell>
        <Cell>More data</Cell>
        <Cell align="right">$280</Cell>
      </Row>
      <Row>
        <Cell>Another data point</Cell>
        <Cell>Additional values</Cell>
        <Cell align="right">$200</Cell>
      </Row>
    </Table>
  </Content>
</Playground>

## Font sizes

Our base font-size is based on our [Spacing](/space) scale for a consistent
sizing rhythm across Jobber. At its' default zoom level, the equivalent is
`16px`. While this is higher than in some systems where `14` may be more common,
Source Sans Pro is optically a bit smaller, particularly at the x-height, so we
start with `16` and work our way up and down from there.

## Line-height

Line-height, or
[leading](https://www.shillingtoneducation.com/blog/leading-typography/), is the
space between subsequent lines of type. The line-heights in the `Heading` and
`Text` components are optimized for each variation's unique combination of
font-size, weight, and family, so you don't need to adjust their line-height
manually when you use them.

At smaller sizes, a more generous line-height relative to the font-size allows
the user to more easily parse multiple lines of small text. As font-size
increases into "display" sizes such as a level 1 `Heading`, the ratio of
line-height to font-size decreases as the larger font-size is more readable and
requires less line-to-line breathing room.
