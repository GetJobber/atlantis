# Elevation

> Elevation is the relative distance between two surfaces along the z-axis.
> â€“[Material Design](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html)

In Atlantis, our web components use elevation to specify position on the z-axis,
with shadows separately responsible for conveying that depth. Our mobile
components combine these two concepts in keeping with Android and iOS patterns.

> Our web implementation was built first and didn't consider these shared
> concerns at the time but we may reconcile web and mobile concepts in the
> future.

Generally speaking, the "higher" an element sits in the z-axis, the broader its'
shadow should spread, to reflect diffusion in the distance between the element
and the ground. As an element gets nearer to the ground, or "lower", the
shadow's spread should reduce and the shadow may appear darker.

We also include a _slight_ y-axis offset of elevation shadows to imply that the
light source is coming from an angle slightly over the head of a user looking
directly into the screen.

## Web

The following table lists all elements that has a z-index specified on it.

export function Value({ of: type }) {
  const styles = getComputedStyle(document.documentElement);
  const getValue = styles.getPropertyValue(`--elevation-${type}`);
  return <React.Fragment>{getValue}</React.Fragment>;
}

| Component        | Value                  |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- |
| Form field label | <Value of="base" />    |
| Menu             | <Value of="menu" />    |
| Modal            | <Value of="modal" />   |
| Tooltip          | <Value of="tooltip" /> |

## Mobile

For mobile designs, the concept of elevation applies to both shadows and
hierarchy of the element along the z-index. Currently we have 3 defined levels
of elevation:

### Low

A low element may have a slight elevation, but is not necessarily something that
will glide across the surface. A card that holds interactive controls within
itself, but that does not have any interactions itself, may be useful to
indicate as "low".

### Base

This shadow should be used for most instances of shadows, as it conveys an
elevation that is noticeable but not aggressively close to the user. An element
with a base elevation is likely interactive, and this level can indicate and
invite the use of gesture controls.

### High

High elements should be elements that float overtop the entire interface, likely
with a fixed position. The "high" elevation indicates that the element has
broken the plane of the view.
