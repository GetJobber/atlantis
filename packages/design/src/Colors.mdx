# Colors

Color can provide a visual cue for users to navigate and understand an
interface.

Atlantis is built with a
[semantic layer](https://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7)
overtop of a base palette. Use the semantic color values whenever possible to
ensure you are using colors for their intended purpose.

## Typography

Typographic elements in Jobber should use consistent colors to ensure readability.

### Heading

Headings have a bold, dark color to cement their hierarchy.

### Text

A slightly softer color is used for body text for greater readability.

#### Text--Supporting

Text that is relevant but less important can be lower-contrast to suggest its’ reduced importance.

## Interactive

Use these colors in buttons and form  controls to communicate the presence and meaning of interaction.

### Interactive

The default color used for interactive elements.

### Destructive

Use to signfify that an interaction will destroy something in the users’ account or workflow.

### Cancel

Use to signify that an interaction will cancel or exit a workflow

### Disabled

Use to signify that an interactive element is disabled.

#### Disabled--Secondary

Use when a disabled element needs more than one shade.

### Focus

Use to indicate that an element has been focused.

## Status

Use these colors in labels, icons, filters, alerts, and other elements where color can add meaning to the state of the system or an item in the system.

### Critical

Action required; user must see this status to be unblocked.

### Warning

Action _may_ be required as a consequence of current state.

### Success

No action required; an action has completed successfully.

### Informative

No action required; but helpful to know about.

### Inactive

No action required; not part of an active workflow.

## Surfaces

Surfaces are the background-colors of almost every element in Jobber.

### Surface

Most elements in Jobber have a white surface; if clickable, they have a light hover color.

### Surface--Background

A slightly darker surface gives a receded appearance relative to main surfaces.

### Surface--Reverse

When a strong constrast is needed with the rest of the application, a reversed surface can be used.

#### Status Surfaces

Elements that convey status have surface colors to help signify their meaning.

##### Surface--Error

Follow guidelines for Status/Critical.

##### Surface--Warning

Follow guidelines for Status/Warning.

##### Surface--Success

Follow guidelines for Status/Success.

##### Surface--Notice

Follow guidelines for Status/Informative.

## Borders

Defining the edges of elements on the same elevation plane, border colors are the subtle maintainers of layout structure.

### Border

Most of our borders should use this color for subtle definition.

### Border--Section

Use where other bordered content is being further sectioned, such as table headers or list sections.

## Brand

Use these colors to represent the Jobber brand visual language.

### Brand

The primary color associated with our brand, from website to ads to product; AKA “Jobber Green”.

### Brand--Highlight

Use to highlight an element in a way that aligns with our website. Use with caution, it’s _bright!_

<Banner type="warning" dismissible={false}>
  Color should never be the _single_ means of conveying information in an
  interface. Use labels, iconography, or hints for assistive technology
  alongside color to ensure your content can be understood by everyone.
