# Colors

Color can provide a visual cue for users to navigate and understand an
interface.

Atlantis is built with a
[semantic layer](https://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7)
overtop of a base palette. Use the semantic color values whenever possible to
ensure you are using colors for their intended purpose.

<Banner type="warning" dismissible={false}>
  Color should never be the single means of conveying information in an
  interface. Use labels, iconography, or hints for assistive technology
  alongside color to ensure your content can be understood by everyone.

## Usage Guidelines

### Typography

Typographic elements in Jobber should use consistent colors to ensure
readability.

#### Heading

Headings have a bold, high-contrast color to cement their hierarchy.

#### Text

A slightly softer color is used for body text for greater readability.

##### Text--Supporting

Text that is relevant but less important can be lower-contrast to suggest its’
reduced importance.

### Interactive

Use these colors in buttons and form controls to communicate the presence and
meaning of interaction.

#### Interactive

The default color used for interactive elements.

#### Destructive

Use to signfify that an interaction will destroy something in the users’ account
or workflow.

#### Cancel

Use to signify that an interaction will cancel or exit a workflow

#### Disabled

Use to signify that an interactive element is disabled.

##### Disabled--Secondary

Use when a disabled element needs more than one color to be readable in a
disabled state; for example, a button's background and label colors must be
different.

#### Focus

Use to indicate that an element has been focused.

### Status

Use these colors in labels, icons, filters, alerts, and other elements where
color can add meaning to the state of the system or an item in the system.

All status colors have a main color, a surface color, and an on-surface color.
The on-surface color should be used for an element when it sits inside of an
element with the status' surface color to maintain a cohesive tone and ensure
sufficient color contrast.

#### Critical

Action required; user must see this status to be unblocked.

#### Warning

Action _may_ be required as a consequence of current state.

#### Success

No action required; an action has completed successfully.

#### Informative

No action required; but helpful to know about.

#### Inactive

No action required; not part of an active workflow.

### Surfaces

Surfaces are the background-colors of almost every element in Jobber.

#### Surface

Most elements in Jobber have a light surface to indicate their nearness to the
user; if clickable, they have a hover color.

#### Surface--Background

A slightly darker surface gives a receded appearance relative to main surfaces.

#### Surface--Reverse

When a strong constrast is needed with the rest of the application, a reversed
surface can be used.

### Borders

Defining the edges of elements on the same elevation plane, border colors are
the subtle maintainers of layout structure.

#### Border

Most of our borders should use this color for subtle definition.

#### Border--Section

Use where other bordered content is being further sectioned, such as table
headers or list sections.

### Brand

Use these colors to represent the Jobber brand visual language.

#### Brand

The primary color associated with our brand, from website to ads to product; AKA
“Jobber Green”.

#### Brand--Highlight

Use to highlight an element in a way that aligns with our website. Use with
caution, it’s _bright!_
