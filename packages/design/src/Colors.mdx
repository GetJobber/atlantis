# Colors

Color can provide a visual cue for users to navigate and understand an
interface.

Atlantis is built with a
[semantic layer](https://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7)
overtop of a base palette. Use the semantic color values whenever possible to
ensure you are using colors for their intended purpose.

<Banner type="warning" dismissible={false}>
  Color should never be the single means of conveying information in an
  interface. Use labels, iconography, or hints for assistive technology
  alongside color to ensure your content can be understood by everyone.
</Banner>
