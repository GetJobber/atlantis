# Colors

Color can provide a visual cue for users to navigate and understand an
interface.

By defining and adding meaning to color use, can can build simpler, more
consistent interfaces and a more accessible product for all.

Atlantis is built with a semantic layer overtop of a base pallet; use the
semantic color values whenever possible to ensure you are using colors for their
intended purpose.

  Color should never be the single means of conveying information in an
  interface. Use labels, iconography, or hints for assistive technology
  alongside color to ensure your content can be understood by everyone.
