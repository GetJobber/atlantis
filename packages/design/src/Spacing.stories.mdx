# Spacing

Our spacing system exists to support the foundational visual design principle of
[proximity-based grouping:](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/gestalt-proximity/)

> Using varying amounts of whitespace to either unite or separate elements is
> key to communicating meaningful groupings.

In the shortest, simplest terms: the closer two elements are related, the
tighter the spacing between them should be.

With this in mind, let’s start small and work our way up.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Miniscule and Smallest

At their respective sizes (`1px` and `2px` equivalent), these values should
mostly be used to provide optical adjustments where an element is visually
misaligned.

### Smaller

The `smaller` spacing value can be used between contents of a single component.
For example, see the spacing between an Icon and the label inside of a
[Button.](../?path=/docs/components-actions-button-docs--page#icons)

### Small

Sibling items within a container can be separated by the `small` value to
reflect their relation to each other. An example would be the spacing between
[Chips in a selection group.](../?path=/docs/components-selections-chips--chips#single-select)

### Base

Use `base` as the default spacing in larger content containers with multiple
children of their own, such as
[Card.](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card-docs--page) This
should also be used as the default starting point for spacing between
[Form](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-form-docs--page) elements.

![illustration of spacing between form elements inside of a card](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39704901/143141662-0f20eec4-8b27-44fe-96f5-1bf1c4d567aa.png)

### Large

Use `large` spacing for higher-level "parent" containers.
[Modal](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-modal-docs--page) uses `large`
spacing in its header and around the edges to give itself a bit more prominence
as a "standalone" view, in a similar manner to
[Page](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-page-docs--page).

`Large` can also be used to help give a "floating" element some clear separation
from the edge of its container, as seen in
[Toast](../?path=/docs/components-status-and-feedback-toast-docs--page).

![illustration of the large space around a Modal's header and content, a Page's outer padding, and a Toast near the bottom of a viewport](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39704901/143152557-8fca3292-dc07-4f9b-a33b-f4d4603c9dd2.png)

### Larger

`Larger` doubles the value of `base` to very clearly delineate two groups of
content that themselves use `base`. It may be useful if you have a long list of
mixed content types that need to be broken up.

![illustration of larger spacing being used to break up unrelated sections of content](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39704901/143141846-43606573-1383-4ad2-9d95-46611488cbae.png)

### Largest and Extravagant

You’ll probably never need these unless you’re doing a custom layout, but
they’re here if you need ‘em. These values are equivalent to `48px` and `64px`
respectively.

## Implementation

### Content

Use the
[Content component](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-content-docs--page)
for any instances where you need uniform spacing between elements.

Content can set its spacing to either `small`, `base`, or `large`; follow the
guidelines above as needed.

### Values

export function Example({ of: size }) {
  const style = {
    width: `var(--space-${size})`,
    height: "var(--space-base)",
    backgroundColor: "var(--color-indigo)",
  };
  return <div style={style} />;
}

export function Height({ of: size }) {
  const element = document.createElement("div");
  element.style.height = `var(--space-${size})`;
  document.body.appendChild(element);
  const value = getComputedStyle(element).height;
  element.remove();
  return value;
}
