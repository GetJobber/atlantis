# Responsive Breakpoints

**To make most components responsive, you will want to use the
<a href="../?path=/docs/hooks-useresizeobserver--use-resize-observer">useResizeObserver
hook</a> so that the component can be responsive based on its container.**

However, there are times the component will not care about its container and
want to be responsive based on the browser size. For this you will want to use a
breakpoint in the CSS.

**Note** Components should be styled mobile first, meaning that it should be
styled for small screens and then scaled up. This means that the `--handhelds`
breakpoint should be rarely considered.

**Note** Media queries can be nested inside selectors. This will help with
clarity when reading.

| Breakpoint         | Width       |
| :----------------- | :---------- |
| `--handhelds`      | `< 640px`   |
| `--medium-screens` | `>= 640px`  |
| `--wide-screens`   | `>= 1024px` |

## Usage

```css
.foo {
  ...;
  /** small screens first **/
  padding: var(--space-base);

  @media (--medium-screens) {
    padding: var(--space-large);
  }

  @media (--wide-screens) {
    padding: var(--space-extravagant);
  }
}
```
