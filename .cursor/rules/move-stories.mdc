We need to copy/move files from `docs` to `packages/site/src/content`

## Example

We recently copied Button docs to this new location.

Before: `docs/components/Button/Button.stories.mdx`

After: `packages/site/src/content/Button/Button.stories.mdx`



## Modify the original file

After copying the file to its new location, the original file was updated in a few ways:

1. Remove all imports except `import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";`
2. Update the `<Meta>` component to remove the "component" prop
3. Keep the H1 heading
4. Remove all content from the file
5. Add a single line below the H1 which points to the new docs location. See the complete example below.

```mdx
import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

<Meta title="Components/Actions/Button" component={Button} />
<Meta title="Components/Actions/Button" />

# Button

{<a href="https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/Button">Button docs</a>} have moved to the new site.
```
