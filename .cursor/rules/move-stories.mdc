Move Storybook MDX files from `docs` to the new docs site, and leave a minimal stub in the original location that links to the new page.

## What to move

- Source: `docs/components/<Component>/<Component>.stories.mdx`
- Destination: `packages/site/src/content/<Component>/<Component>.stories.mdx`

Example (Button):

- Before: `docs/components/Button/Button.stories.mdx`
- After: `packages/site/src/content/Button/Button.stories.mdx`

## How to update the original file (stub)

After copying to the destination, replace the original file's contents with a lightweight stub:

1. Keep only this import: `import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";`
2. Use `<Meta ... />` without the `component` prop. Preserve the existing title path string, only remove the `component` prop.
3. Keep the existing H1 heading (e.g., `# Button`). Do not change the text.
4. Remove all other content from the file.
5. Add one line below the H1 that links to the new docs page on the site.

### Stub template (replace Button with the component name as needed)

```mdx
import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

<Meta title="Components/Actions/Button" />

# Button

[Button docs](/components/button) have moved to the new site.
```

Notes:

- Keep the `title` value consistent with the original file; only remove the `component` prop.
- Update the URL path (`/components/Button`) to the correct component slug when not "Button".
