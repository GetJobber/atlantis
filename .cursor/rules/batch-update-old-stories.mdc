Write a bash script that updates our old Storybook MDX files under `docs` to link to the new docs site.

## What to update

Source: `docs/components/<Component>/<Component>.stories.mdx`

Example (Button): `docs/components/Button/Button.stories.mdx`

## How to update the file

1. Keep only this import: `import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";`
2. Use `<Meta ... />` without the `component` prop. Preserve the existing title path string, only remove the `component` prop.
3. Keep the existing H1 heading (e.g., `# Button`). Do not change the text.
4. Remove all content BELOW the H1 heading
5. Add one line below the H1 that links to the new docs page on the site.

### Example output (replace Button with the component name as needed)

```mdx
import { Meta } from "@storybook/addon-docs";

<Meta title="Components/Actions/Button" />

# Button

[Button docs](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/Button) have moved to the new site.
```

Notes:

- Keep the `title` value exactly the same; only remove the `component` prop.
- Update the URL path (`https://atlantis.getjobber.com/components/Button`) to the correct component slug for this file.


## Important

You are only writing a bash script `./batch-update-old-stories.sh` which uses commands available on macOS to do these actions.
