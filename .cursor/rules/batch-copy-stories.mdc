Write a bash script that copies Storybook MDX files from `docs` to the new docs site.

## What to copy

- Source: `docs/components/<Component>/<Component>.stories.mdx`
- Destination: `packages/site/src/content/<Component>/<Component>.stories.mdx`

Example (Button):

- Before: `docs/components/Button/Button.stories.mdx`
- After: `packages/site/src/content/Button/Button.stories.mdx`


## Important

You are only writing a bash script `./batch-copy.sh` which uses commands available on macOS to batch copy all of those files to their new locations.
