# useDebounce

`useDebounce` is a hook that creates a debounced version of a function that will
only call the function after a specified delay has passed since the last time it
was invoked.

This hook manages the requirements of debouncing functions in React, since a
stable reference to the debounced function is required. The hook automatically
handles cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

This is especially useful when handling frequent events like typing, scrolling,
or resizing where you want to limit how often the handler is actually called.

```tsx
import { useDebounce } from "@jobber/hooks";
```

The hook takes a function, a wait delay (in milliseconds), and optional debounce
settings.
