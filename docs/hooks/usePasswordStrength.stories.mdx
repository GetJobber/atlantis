# usePasswordStrength

`usePasswordStrength` is a hook used to calculate the strength of a password
using the [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) package. You can use it
as-is or pass a dictionary of common passwords which should be treated as
insecure.

```tsx
import { usePasswordStrength } from "@jobber/hooks/usePasswordStrength";
```

  <UsePasswordStrength />
