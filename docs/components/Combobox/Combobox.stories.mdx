# Combobox

The Combobox component is designed to provide a versatile and accessible
interface for selecting options from a list. Comboboxes can be used for a
variety of scenarios, such as selecting items from a predefined list, filtering
and searching through data.

## Design & usage guidelines

Combobox is composed of three main parts:

#### Combobox Trigger

There are two primary options for trigger elements of the Combobox,
TriggerButton and TriggerChip. You must have one Trigger component.

Triggers serve as the user-facing interface to open and close the Combobox and
initiate option selection. The choice between them depends on the design and
user experience requirements.

#### Combobox Content

This component is an integral part of the Combobox and is responsible for
displaying the list of selectable options, handling user interactions, and
managing the search functionality.

#### Combobox Action

Situated at the bottom of the Content, these optional Actions allow users to
perform custom tasks such as adding a new option.

The Combobox component's primary function is to facilitate option selection and
searching within a list of items. It should be used in scenarios where users
need to choose from a set of options, with the added benefit of filtering and
customization.

## Content guidelines

Combobox is designed to handle lists of selectable options, so the component is
primarily text based.

You may customize the trigger and action `label`. Refer to the
[Product Vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--page) for
consistency in terminology and naming conventions when setting these values.

The ComboboxContent also has an optional `subjectNoun` prop which is the
encapsulating noun for the content of the Combobox. It will be used in the empty
state of the Combobox, as well as the noun within the search placeholder. For
example, if your Combobox is a list of possible tax rates to choose from, the
`subjectNoun` would be `"tax rates"`. In the search placeholder, it would read
`"Search tax rates"` and if there are no tax rates, the empty state would read
`"You don't have any tax rates yet"`. If no `subjectNoun` is provided, the
search placeholder will read `"Search"` and the empty state will read
`"No options yet"`.
