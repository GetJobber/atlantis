# Combobox

The Combobox is designed to provide a versatile and accessible interface for
selecting one or more options from a list. Combobox can be used for a variety of
scenarios, such as selecting items from a predefined list, filtering and
searching through data.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Combobox component's primary function is to facilitate option selection and
searching within a list of items.

It should be used in scenarios where users need to choose from a set of options,
with the added benefit of filtering.

The Combobox also has the flexibility to allow for custom actions, such as
adding a new item to the list of options or managing a selection.

## Content guidelines

Combobox is designed to handle lists of selectable options, so the component is
text based.

You may customize the activator and action `label`. Refer to the
[Product Vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--docs) for
consistency in terminology and naming conventions when setting these values.

You may also set an optional `subjectNoun` for the Combobox content. This will
be used in the
[empty state](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--empty-state)
of the Combobox, as well as the noun within the search placeholder.

You may include a prefix element to any ComboBox.Option by setting its `prefix`
prop. This could be a
[StatusIndicator](../?path=/docs/components-status-and-feedback-statusindicator--docs)
or [Icon](../?path=/docs/components-images-and-icons-icon--docs) to provide
additional context to the option.

### Empty states

In cases where the list of options is empty, the Combobox content will display a
message indicating the absence of options. The default will read, _"No options
yet"_ or _"You don't have any [subjectNoun] yet"_ if you've set the
`subjectNoun` prop.

If options are available, but the search query does not match any of them, the
Combobox Content will display a message indicating that no options match the
search query.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard operation

- The activator can be actioned with `space` or `return`
- The Combobox confines tabbing to within itself while it's open using
  [useFocusTrap](../?path=/docs/hooks-usefocustrap--docs)
- Pressing `esc` will close the Combobox and return focus to the activator using
  [useRefocusOnActivator](../?path=/docs/hooks-userefocusonactivator--docs)
- The search input is automatically focused when the Combobox opens. The button
  to clear the input can be focused with `tab`
- The options list is navigated with the `up` and `down` arrow keys, and
  actioned with `space` or `return`, this can be done at any time when the
  Combobox is open
- The actions, if present, are the next tabbable element after the search

### Assistive technology

- The activator element is given a `role="combobox"` to inform the user of the
  type of content they'll be interacting with
- Once the user opens the Combobox, the search input is focused and announced
- The title and "selected/unselected" status of each item is announced as the
  user navigates the options
- The actions (if present) are announced and operable as buttons
