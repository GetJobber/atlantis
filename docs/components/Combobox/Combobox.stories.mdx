Combobox is a selection component that allows users to select a single option
from a dropdown.

## Design & usage guidelines

Combobox is composed of three main parts:

1. Combobox Trigger - This is the element that opens and closes the dropdown.
2. Combobox Content - This displays the available options for selection, as well
   as the search functionality and Actions.
3. Combobox Action - Situated at the bottom of the Content, these optional
   Actions allow users to perform additional tasks such as adding new options.

When composing Combobox, keep in mind:

- You must have one Trigger component and one Content component.
- Actions are optional.
