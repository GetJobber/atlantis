# Combobox

The Combobox component is designed to provide a versatile and accessible
interface for selecting options from a list. Comboboxes can be used for a
variety of scenarios, such as selecting items from a predefined list, filtering
and searching through data.

## Design & usage guidelines

Combobox is composed of three main parts:

#### Combobox Trigger

There are two primary options for trigger elements of the Combobox,
TriggerButton and TriggerChip. You must have one Trigger component.

Triggers serve as the user-facing interface to open and close the Combobox and
initiate option selection. The choice between them depends on the design and
user experience requirements.

#### Combobox Content

This component is an integral part of the Combobox and is responsible for
displaying the list of selectable options, handling user interactions, and
managing the search functionality.

#### Combobox Action

Situated at the bottom of the Content, these optional Actions allow users to
perform custom tasks such as adding a new option.

The Combobox component's primary function is to facilitate option selection and
searching within a list of items. It should be used in scenarios where users
need to choose from a set of options, with the added benefit of filtering and
customization.
