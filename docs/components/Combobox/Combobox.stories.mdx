# Combobox

The Combobox is designed to provide a versatile and accessible interface for
selecting one or more options from a list. Combobox can be used for a variety of
scenarios, such as selecting items from a predefined list, filtering and
searching through data.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Combobox component's primary function is to facilitate option selection and
searching within a list of items.

It should be used in scenarios where users need to choose from a set of options,
with the added benefit of filtering.

The Combobox also has the flexibility to allow for custom actions, such as
adding a new item to the list of options or managing a selection.

### Structure

Combobox is composed of three main parts:

#### Trigger

The trigger is the user-facing interface to open and close the Combobox and
initiate option selection. When implementing Combobox, you may rely on the
default trigger or, you may pass in a custom activator.

The default trigger is a
[Chip](../?path=/story/components-selections-chip-web--subtle) containing a
label that reads "Select" and an `add` Icon suffix. The label can be customized
by adding the optional `label` prop to better reflect the type of data being
selected. Examples of using a default trigger can be found in the
[single-select](../?path=/code/components-selections-combobox-web--single-select)
and
[multi-select](../?path=/code/components-selections-combobox-web--multi-select)
stories.

Notice that omitting a trigger subcomponent will result in the default trigger
being used.

The custom activator should be used when the Combobox trigger is a
[Button](../?path=/docs/components-actions-button-docs--page) or an alternate
variation of Chip. Button or Chip should be a child of `<Combobox.Activator />`
and will be rendered in place of the default trigger. Examples of using a custom
activator can be found in the
[custom activator](../?path=/code/components-selections-combobox-web--custom-activator)
story.

#### Content

The content of the Combobox is responsible for displaying the list of selectable
options, handling user interactions, and managing search functionality.

`<Combobox.Option />` is a wrapper component that should be used to wrap each
individual option within the list.

#### Action

Actions are an optional way to allow users to perform custom tasks such as
adding a new item to the list of options.

### Selection behavior

#### Single-select

Single-select is ComboBox's default selection mode. When a selection is made,
the Combobox will close.

#### Multi-select

Add the `multiSelect` prop to allow multiple options to be selected and/or
un-selected. In multi-select mode, the Combobox will only close when a user
takes an explicit action to close it such as clicking outside the Combobox or
pressing the ESC key.

When `multiSelect` is enabled, a Combobox header will be displayed below the
search input.

When no selections have been made, the header label will read "Select" and the
button will read "Select all". When clicking "Select all", all options will be
selected.

When one or more options have been selected, the header label will show the
number of selected items, like a counter. The button will then read "Clear".
When clicking "Clear", all options will be un-selected. If you have filtered the
options, the "Clear" button will un-select each option selected, whether present
in the filtered results or not.

#### Selection callbacks

As selections are made, the data will be returned via an argument to the
callbacks passed in through either the `onClose` or `onSelect` prop on
`Combobox.Content`. **Only one or the other may be provided**.

`onSelect` is the recommended callback handler that should be used in most
cases. This will immediately inform the consumer of changes to selections as
they happen.

`onClose` should be used when you need to wait until all selections have been
made before applying changes.

The arguments provided to the `onClose` callback are identical to those of
`onSelect`, only the timing differs. As such, please note this will only have a
noticeable effect with the `multiSelect` variation which remains open after
making selections whereas the Combobox closes immediately upon selection with
single-select.

Combobox has no predefined visual representation of the selections outside of
the internal list. It is up to the consumer to decide how to best represent
these selections in their UI, if at all.

## Content guidelines

Combobox is designed to handle lists of selectable options, so the component is
text based.

You may customize the trigger and action `label`. Refer to the
[Product Vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--page) for
consistency in terminology and naming conventions when setting these values.

You may also set an optional `subjectNoun` for the Combobox content. This will
be used in the
[empty state](../?path=/story/components-selections-combobox-web--empty-state)
of the Combobox, as well as the noun within the search placeholder.

### Empty states

In cases where the list of options is empty, the Combobox content will display a
message indicating the absence of options. The default will read, _"No options
yet"_ or _"You don't have any [subjectNoun] yet"_ if you've set the
`subjectNoun` prop.

If options are available, but the search query does not match any of them, the
Combobox Content will display a message indicating that no options match the
search query.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard operation

- The trigger can be actioned with `space` or `return`
- The Comobox confines tabbing to within itself while it's open using
  [useFocusTrap](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/?path=/docs/hooks-usefocustrap--use-focus-trap)
- Pressing `esc` will close the Combobox and return focus to the trigger using
  [useRefocusOnActivator](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/?path=/docs/hooks-userefocusonactivator--use-refocus-on-activator)
- The search input is automatically focused when the Combobox opens. The button
  to clear the input can be focused with `tab`
- The options list is navigated with the `up` and `down` arrow keys, and
  actioned with `space` or `return`, this can be done at any time when the
  Combobox is open
- The actions, if present, are the next tabbable element after the search

### Assistive technology

- The trigger element is given a `role="combobox"` to inform the user of the
  type of content they'll be interacting with
- Once the user opens the Combobox, the search input is focused and announced
- The title and "selected/unselected" status of each item is announced as the
  user navigates the options
- The actions (if present) are announced and operable as buttons

## Testing

When using Jest to test Combobox implementations, you will need to include this
mock in your test setup:

```js
const scrollIntoViewMock = jest.fn();
window.HTMLElement.prototype.scrollIntoView = scrollIntoViewMock;
```
