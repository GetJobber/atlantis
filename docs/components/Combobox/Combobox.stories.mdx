## Design & usage guidelines

The Combobox will... _Add a brief description of the design and usage of the
component_

<!--
  What is the design purpose of this component? How do its responsibilities
  relate to other components? What should this component not be used for?
  Try to describe this component not in terms of what it looks like or what
  elements make it up, but what function it performs or how it enables a user
  to perform tasks (e.g. “Buttons allow users to initiate, complete, and reverse
  actions.” vs “Buttons are rectangular elements that have a green background and white text”).
-->

## Content guidelines

<!--
  What type of content does this component present (documents, text, images, other components)?
  What is the recommended, or expected, amount of content? What is the components’ behaviour when
  the provided content diverges from what is expected (image aspect ratio, amount of text, video
  vs audio, filesize)? Are there any important references to the [Product Vocabulary](https://atlantis.getjobber.com/guides/product-vocabulary)
  that should be made regarding this component? What happens when content is unavailable or unreliable
  (poor connection, empty states, flaky GPS data?)
-->

## Related components

## Related patterns

<!--
  Is there a pattern related to this component?
-->

## Related resources

<!--
  Is there any related resource (internal or external) to this component?
-->

## Platform considerations

<!--
  Mostly for mobile components. Is there something that applies only for Android/iOS or
  is browser-specific?
-->

## Accessibility

<!--
  Describe the accessibility concerns for the component. How does it handle touch vs cursor vs
  keyboard events? Should it capture input? What should a screen reader see when it's focuse?
-->

## Responsiveness

<!--
  How should the component behave on an iPhone 8? An iPad? A 1920x1080 monitor? How does the
  component appear when the component itself is less than 375px wide? Less than 640px wide?
  Less than 1200px wide? Greater than 1200px? Does it change when the device DPI is higher
  or lower?
-->

## Mockup

<Figma collapsable />

<!--
  Insert a Figma mockup from the [Design System Contribution template](https://www.figma.com/file/3BXCXXD9glMtj8RAHjXiQC/Design-System-Contribution-TEMPLATE?node-id=26%3A2)
  that conveys the visual design of the component, with variants and state accounted for.
  Consider progressive enhancement; might this rely on newer browser features that aren’t
  widely supported yet?
-->

## Notes

<!--
  What decisions worth remembering have gone into this component? Did we consider any potentially valuable
  functionality that we’re not implementing right now for scope purposes? Are there any design decisions
  that might need explaining beyond the usage guidelines? This will help consumers understand this component
  more fully.
