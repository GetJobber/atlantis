# Combobox

Combobox is a selection component that allows users to select a single option
from a dropdown.

## Design & usage guidelines

Combobox is composed of a trigger element, a dropdown panel and optional
actions. Selecting the trigger opens the dropdown panel below it, referred to as
the `Combobox.Content`. The `Combobox.Content` displays the available options in
a list. Clicking or selecting an option closes the dropdown and sets the
selected value.
