# Input Date

InputDate provides a multi-modal way for the user to select a date, using
either:

- Form Field
- Visual calendar selector and comes complete with the ability to re-format user
  input into an expected date format.

## Design & usage guidelines

The InputDate should be used in most cases where the user needs to select a
date.

### States

#### Disabled

<Canvas>
  <InputDate placeholder="Start Date" disabled={true} onChange={undefined} />
</Canvas>

#### Invalid

<Canvas>
  <InputDate
    placeholder="Start date"
    invalid="Start Date is required"
    onChange={undefined}
  />
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

The InputDate should only be used to display and submit date values. For other
input usage, see [Related Components](#related-components).

## Responsiveness

When the InputDate is near the top or bottom of the viewport, the Datepicker
will adjust its position to remain in view.

The FormField for InputDate will take up the full available width of its parent.
If used in an
[InputGroup](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputgroup--input-group),
it will take up the available amount of space left by any other inputs in the
group.

## Related components

- On web if you do not need an accompanying form field, you can use the
  [Datepicker](../?path=/docs/components-selections-datepicker--date-picker#date-picker)
  on its own
- If you need to allow the user to enter time, use
  [InputTime](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime--input-time)
- If you just need a text input, use
  [InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext--input-text)

## Notes

Some functionality that we have opted not to introduce at this time, but that
would be relatively feasible to add in the future:

- allow for the concept of a date-range selection
- allow for certain days or dates to be excluded from selection

## Accessibility

Accessibility concerns for the InputDate are captured by:

### FormField

Provides a label, announces input type, can be focused, and handles error
validation and messaging.

### Datepicker

[Datepicker](../?path=/docs/components-selections-datepicker--date-picker#date-picker#accessibility)
is keyboard-operable and announces the currently-focused date available for
selection to the user via assistive technology.
