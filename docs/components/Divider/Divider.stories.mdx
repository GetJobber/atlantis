# Divider

The Divider component is used to separate content into different sections.

## Design & usage guidelines

Divider comes with no spacing around it. This means that it should be used
within a
[Content](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-content-docs--page)
component.

### Size

For different levels of segmentation, you may find the need to use larger
Dividers. As Dividers increase in size, they get lighter to offset the visual
impact of their additional weight.
