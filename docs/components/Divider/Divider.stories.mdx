# Divider

Divider is a UI element meant to divide into areas of content.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Divider component comes with no spacing around it. This means that it should
be used within a
[`Content`](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-content-docs--page)
component.

### Size

For different levels of segmentation, you may find the need to use larger
Dividers. As Dividers increase in size, they get lighter to offset the visual
impact of their additional weight.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Heading level={2}>Intro Section</Heading>
    <Text>Important main content</Text>
    <Divider size="largest" />
    <Content>Some amazing content</Content>
    <Divider size="large" />
    <Content>Even more amazing content</Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>
