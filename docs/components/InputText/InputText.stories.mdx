# Input Text

Input text is used in forms that accept short or long answers from users.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Controlled

Use this to allow users to provide short answers.

export const ControlledExample = () => {
  const [age, setAge] = useState("Veintisiete");
  return (
    <InputText
      value={age}
      onChange={setAge}
      name="age"
      placeholder="Age in words"
    />
  );
};

<Canvas>
  <ControlledExample />
</Canvas>

<Disclosure title="Show code">
```tsx
const ControlledExample = () => {
  const [age, setAge] = useState("Veintisiete");
  return (
    <InputText
      value={age}
      onChange={setAge}
      name="age"
      placeholder="Age in words"
    />
  );
};
```
</Disclosure>

### Multiline

Use this to allow users to provide long answers. The default number of rows is
three. Note that `loading={true}` is unimplemented for multiline input text.

For web, you can set a minimum and maximum number of rows. See:
[Web/rows example](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext-web--multiline).

<Canvas>
  <InputText multiline={true} placeholder="Describe your age" />
</Canvas>

### Prefix/suffix

Use a prefix or suffix when additional visual cues about an input's function may
be helpful.

Some fields have common visual patterns such as “search” having a magnifying
glass icon, “Select” having a downwards arrow, or currency inputs having a
currency symbol. These signifiers reinforce the purpose of the input to increase
[Recognition over Recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
and align the input with
[Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
With clearer guidance around the purpose of inputs, the user is able to better
focus on the task at hand.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <InputText
      defaultValue="1,000,000"
      placeholder="Invoice Total"
      prefix={{ label: "$", icon: "invoice" }}
      suffix={{ label: ".00" }}
    />
    <InputText
      placeholder="Search"
      prefix={{ icon: "search" }}
      suffix={{
        icon: "cross",
        ariaLabel: "clear search",
        onClick: () => alert("This could clear a search value"),
      }}
    />
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Validation message

You can add your own custom validation messages on a field to assist the user in
successfully completing a form. This doesn't _replace_ server-side validation,
but minimizes the need for it as the user should be set up for success by proper
guidance pre-submission before any "bad" data gets to the server.

Follow the
[product vocabulary](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--docs#general-phrasing)
for guidance on writing helpful error messages.

Atlantis utilizes [React Hook Forms](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle
`input` and `form` validation. This means that the
[React Hook Forms validation options](https://react-hook-form.com/api#register)
are available out of the box.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- `required` - A Boolean which, if true, indicates that the input must have a
  value.
- `maxLength` - The maximum length of the value to accept for this input.
- `minLength` - The minimum length of the value to accept for this input.
- `pattern` - The regex pattern for the input.
- `validate` - You can pass a callback function as the argument to validate, or
  you can pass an object of callback functions to validate all of them.

<Canvas>
  <InputText
    placeholder="What's your age"
    validations={{
      required: {
        value: true,
        message: "You have to tell us your age",
      },
      validate: val => {
        if (val.length > 0 && !isNaN(val)) {
          return "Type your age in words please.";
        }
        if (val.length >= 10) {
          return "That seems too old.";
        }
        return true;
      },
    }}
  />
</Canvas>

## States

### Disabled

<Canvas>
  <InputText
    placeholder="Credit card"
    value="**** **** **** 1234"
    disabled={true}
  />
</Canvas>

### Invalid

For mobile, you can pass a string to the `invalid` prop to display an error.
See:
[Mobile/invalid example](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext-mobile--invalid).

<Canvas>
  <InputText placeholder="Email" value="atlantis" invalid={true} />
</Canvas>

### External label

You can use `FormFieldLabel` to provide a label outside of the input. The
`showMiniLabel` prop on `InputText` can be used to hide the mini label that
appears when a value is provided.

<style>
  {`
  .fullWidth {
    width: 100%;
  }
`}
</style>

<Canvas>
  <div className="fullWidth">
    <FormFieldLabel external={true} htmlFor="ext-input">
      External label
    </FormFieldLabel>
    <InputText
      showMiniLabel={false}
      placeholder="You can still have a placeholder"
      id="ext-input"
    />
  </div>
</Canvas>

### Keyboard

Determine what default keyboard appears on mobile.

<Canvas>
  <InputText placeholder="Describe your age" keyboard="numeric" />
</Canvas>

### Using onValidation (Web)

If you need to capture the error message and render it outside of the component.
Read the
[InputValidation](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputvalidation--docs)
documentation.

### Version 2 Shim (Experimental)

If you need to use the version 2 shim, you can pass `version={2}` to the
`InputText` and provide the required props. Due to issues with typescript
[see](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32447) the aria attributes
(and other props separated by `-`) are not typed correctly. This means that the
shim will not enforce the version to be set to `2` when using these props. As a
result version 1 usages will have these props appear in the intellisense but
they will not do anything.
