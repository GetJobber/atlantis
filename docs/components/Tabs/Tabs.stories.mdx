# Tabs

Tabs are used to alternate amongst related views within the same context.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Tabs when you need to group related sub-groups of content and the user only
needs to access one sub-group at a time.

Do not use Tabs as a means of navigating the view or in lieu of a Table of
Contents.

## Related components

To show multiple groupings of content at once, use
[Card](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card-docs--page).

To allow the user to select one-of-many options in a form, use
[RadioGroup](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-radiogroup-docs--page)
or [Select](../?path=/docs/components-selections-select--select).

## Accessibility

Tabs have known accessibility concerns, including:

- the user cannot navigate between Tabs using the arrow keys
  - this breaks a universal expectation for tabbed interfaces
- the user cannot keyboard-navigate directly from the selected Tab into the
  selected Tab content
  - initial keypress of `tab` key or `command+option+right` focuses next Tab
