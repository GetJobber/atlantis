# Data Table

Data Tables are used to organize and display tabular data to users while
providing a multitude of features that allows the user to interact with the data
been displayed on the table.

The `DataTable` component has the capability to integrate sorting, filtering and
pagination with an external API or on the client side.

## Design & usage guidelines

The `DataTable` component is a great solution if you are looking to display data
in a tabular way while giving your user the ability to sort, paginate or filter
that data, this can be implemented on the server side or on the client side
depending on your needs.

A best practice in Data Table presentation is to ensure that all columns with
numerical data (and their headers) round to the same decimal point, and are
right-aligned. This makes it much easier for the reader to quickly parse large
distinctions in dollar amounts, inventory counts, and other key business data.

To list more complex collections of information (such as multi-line content like
a detailed property address), you may want to consider the
[List](../?path=/docs/components-lists-and-tables-list--list) component. If you
have a small list of information with a 1:1 label-to-data relationship (for
example, the issued and due dates on an invoice), consider using
[DescriptionList](../?path=/docs/components-lists-and-tables-descriptionlist--description-list).

## Responsiveness

The `DataTable` component has the option to handle responsive design, these
options will allow us to fix the header or the first left column depending on
your needs, this will allow the user a more efficient way to visualize the data.
