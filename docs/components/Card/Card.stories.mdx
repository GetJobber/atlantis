# Card

A card is used to group related information and tasks so our users can scan and
prioritize information more easily.

## Design & usage guidelines

A card is useful for grouping content because of its distinct visual boundaries.
However, similar to the idea that "making everything stand out means that
nothing stands out", you should be mindful in your application of cards.

A card should be the smallest-possible self-contained section of content. If you
find yourself putting a card inside of another card, the outer card should be
removed, and it may be worth re-assessing the hierarchy of your interface.

### Elevation (Mobile)

By default, it should be assumed that a Card is on the same "plane" as the
surface it sits on and has no elevation.

If the Card benefits from having elevation indicated, such as when it sits
overtop another Card or is used in a Carousel fashion, the appropriate elevation
level can be set. See Mobile/Elevation for an example.

## Content guidelines

Card headers should be sentence-cased.

| ✅ Do                   | ❌ Don't                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Client property details | Client Property Details |
| Assigned team           | ASSIGNED TEAM           |
| Required deposit        | Required Deposit        |

## Accessibility

The Card itself is already accessible and does not require any additional setup.

With that said, it should not be wrapped in an element with an `aria-label` or
`accessibilityLabel` describing it as a card. This is redundant and will cause
unexpected behaviour for screen readers. For example, adding one on mobile would
hide the whole card from the screen reader.
