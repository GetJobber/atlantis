# Input Email

InputEmail is used to display input with built-in email validation.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use the InputEmail component when you expect the user to input an email address.
By default, the InputEmail component will validate email addresses.

If you want to add additional validation within the Web/JO, you can pass in the
`validations` prop with your own message. Note: The validations prop is not
available on mobile.

## Related components

If you are not worried about email address validation, consider using
