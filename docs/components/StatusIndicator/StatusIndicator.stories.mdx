# Status Indicator

The StatusIndicator component is a purely visual component that indicates a
status (e.g., "Active", "Overdue").

## Usage guidelines

StatusIndicator offers only 5 possible status representations:

### Success

Convey that an item is in a successful state, such as approved or paid.

### Critical

Alert the user to a critically important issue such as a late appointment or an
overdue payment.

### Warning

Warn the user of a potential forthcoming issue like an upcoming deadline or an
item awaiting response.

### Informative

Inform the user about something that may not require action, such as a quote
that has already been converted into a job.

### Inactive

Signify that an item has been archived, closed, or otherwise removed from an
active workflow.
