A toggleable menu that holds a list of actions. Where `InputSelect` is used to
select an item from a list Menu is used to display a dismissible menu of actions
the user can perform.

## Content guidelines

Menu action labels should be sentence-cased. This means in general, capitalize
only the first letter of the label unless there is a proper noun (such as a
person's name) in the label.

Jobber features, such as jobs, quotes, and invoices, are not proper nouns and
[should not be capitalized.](../?path=/docs/content-product-vocabulary--page#concepts-and-items)
