# Content

Content is a container component that provides it's child elements with
consistent vertical or horizontal spacing and padding.

This is useful for when you want to include internal details like text within a
parent component, such as a [Card](/components/Card), while maintaining
consistent spacing between the elements.

## Design & usage guidelines

Content should be used whenever you have a container with children that requires
consistent spacing between the elements.

## Related components

Use [Flex](/components/Flex) and [Grid](/components/Grid) to create more complex
layouts.

## Accessibility

Content supports the use of semantic HTML5 region elements like `<main>`,
`<section>`, `<article>` etc. to further enhance accessibility when used
appropriately. Consider using these if the Content represents a meaningful
region or section of your content. The default tag is a `<div>`.

Children of the Content component should be presented in a logical order, and
follow a sensible hierarchy that can be followed by screen readers.
