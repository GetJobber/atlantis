# Content

Content is a container component that provides it's child elements with
consistent vertical or horizontal spacing and padding.

This is useful for when you want to include internal details like text within a
parent component, such as a
[Card,](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card-docs--page) while
maintaining consistent spacing between the elements.

## Design & usage guidelines

Content should be used whenever you have a container with mixed content that
requires consistent spacing between the elements.

### Related components

Use [Flex](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-flex-docs--page) and
Grid [Grid](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-grid-docs--page) to
create more complex layouts.

## Accessibility

Content has limited accessibility concerns. It is a container component that
does not add any meaningful screen information, nor can it be directly
interacted with.

Children of the Content component should be presented in a logical order, and
follow a sensible hierarchy that can be followed by screen readers.

Content supports the use of semantic HTML5 region elements like `<main>`,
`<section>`, `<article>` etc. to further enhance accessibility when used
appropriately. Consider using these if the Content represents a meaningful
region or section of your content. The default tag is a `<div>`.
