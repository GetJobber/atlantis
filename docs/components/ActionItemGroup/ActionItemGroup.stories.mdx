# Action Item Group

ActionItemGroup is a layout wrapper allowing for quick and easy grouping of
[ActionItems](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem--docs).
It can also house other content alongside an ActionItem if needed.

## Design & usage guidelines

The ActionItemGroup makes it easy to consistently display several ActionItems
alongside each other with dividers to segment each item.

## Content guidelines

You'll mostly be passing ActionItems into ActionItemGroup, but as shown it can
handle other content types if needed.

In forms in particular, you may find the need to add other elements into the
group. You may need to use
[Content](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-content--docs) or
write some styling to get things aligned. In the Mixed Components
[example](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitemgroup-mobile--mixed-components)
you can see Content being used to layout
[Text](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-text--docs) and
[Typography](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-typography--docs)
alongside some
[ActionItems](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem--docs).

## Related components

If you only need one
[ActionItem](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem--docs),
you can use that on its own without this wrapper.

## Accessibility

ActionItemGroup is just a layout wrapper and does not communicate anything to
screen-readers - that's the job of its children.
