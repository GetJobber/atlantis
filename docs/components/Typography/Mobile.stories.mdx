# Typography (Internal)

<Banner type="notice" dismissible={false}>

Typography is the component that powers our Heading and Text components “under
the hood”. You should first look to use
[Heading](/docs/atlantis-text-and-typography-heading--heading) and
[Text](/docs/atlantis-text-and-typography-text--text) before you reach for
Typography.

```ts
import { Typography } from "atlantis/Typography";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Mobile"
    args={{
      children: "Just some type here.",
    }}
  >
    {args => <Typography {...args} />}

## Notes

### Copying text

React Native has a lot of limitations around Android and iOS when it comes to
copying text on a device.

#### Android

- ✅ Highlight specific text
- ✅ Have an option to copy and other smart actions like opening a map when it's
  an address
- ❌ It can't highlight the text on anything that is tappable. For example
  - Button
  - List
  - Long press to copy phone, address, etc
  - In short, anything text you can tap and it does an action like open a modal
    cannot be highlighted

#### iOS

- ❌ Highlight specific text
  - ✅ It can only copy all of the block of text
- ➖ Only have an option to "copy"
- ✅ Unlike Android, It can copy the text on anything that is tappable
  - The long press would show a copy action and cancel the press action on it
