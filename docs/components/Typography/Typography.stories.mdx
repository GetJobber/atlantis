# Typography

<Meta title="Components/Text and Typography/Typography" />

Base component that defines typographic standards across Jobber.

<Banner type="notice" dismissible={false}>

Typography is the component that powers our Heading and Text components "under
the hood". You should first look to use [Heading](/components/Heading) and
[Text](/components/Text) before you reach for Typography.
