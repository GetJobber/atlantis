# Typography

<Meta title="Components/Typography/Docs" component={Typography} />

Base component that defines typographic standards across Jobber.

Typography is the component that powers our Heading and Text components “under
the hood”. You should first look to use
[Heading](/docs/components-heading--heading) and
[Text](/docs/components-text-docs--page) before you reach for Typography.
