# Typography

<Meta title="Components/Text and Typography/Typography/Docs" />

Base component that defines typographic standards across Jobber.

<Banner type="notice" dismissible={false}>

Typography is the component that powers our Heading and Text components “under
the hood”. You should first look to use
[Heading](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-heading-docs--page) and
[Text](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-text-docs--page) before you
reach for Typography.

</Banner>

## Alignment

Uses start and end instead of left and right to allow for resiliency in both LTR
and RTL applications.

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Typography align="start">Start</Typography>
  <Typography align="center">Center</Typography>
  <Typography align="end">End</Typography>
</Canvas>

## Platform considerations

React Native has a lot of limitations around Android and iOS when it comes to
copying text on a device.

#### Android

- ✅ Highlight specific text
- ✅ Have an option to copy and other smart actions like opening a map when it's
  an address
- ❌ It can't highlight the text on anything that is tappable. For example
  - Button
  - List
  - Long press to copy phone, address, etc
  - In short, anything text you can tap and it does an action like open a modal
    cannot be highlighted

#### iOS

- ❌ Highlight specific text
  - ✅ It can only copy all of the block of text
- ➖ Only have an option to "copy"
- ✅ Unlike Android, It can copy the text on anything that is tappable
  - The long press would show a copy action and cancel the press action on it
