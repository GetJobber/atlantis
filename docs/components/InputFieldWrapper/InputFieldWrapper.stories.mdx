# Input Field Wrapper (Internal)

This component is used to wrap input fields such as `InputText` and
`InputPressable` to provide common patterns and functionality present in our
input designs, such as: suffix/prefix icons, placeholders, etc.

Note: example does not have a child component, so no interaction will occur on
click.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Prefix/Suffix

Use a prefix or suffix when additional visual cues about an input's function may
be helpful.

Some fields have common visual patterns such as “search” having a magnifying
glass icon, “Select” having a downwards arrow, or currency inputs having a
currency symbol. These signifiers reinforce the purpose of the input to increase
[Recognition over Recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
and align the input with
[Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
With clearer guidance around the purpose of inputs, the user is able to better
focus on the task at hand. See
[InputFieldWrapper/Prefix and Suffix example](../?path=/story/components-private-inputfieldwrapper-mobile--prefix-and-suffix).

### Clearable

When setting `showClearAction` to `true` you must also provide an `onClear`
callback that will clear the input you are wrapping. See `InputDateTime` and
`InputPressable` or `InputText` for examples.

See
[InputFieldWrapper/Clearable example](../?path=/story/components-private-inputfieldwrapper-mobile--clearable).
