# InputFieldWrapper

This component is used to wrap input fields such as
[InputText](/components/InputText) and
[InputPressable](/components/InputPressable) to provide common patterns and
functionality present in our input designs, such as suffix/prefix icons,
placeholders, etc.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Prefix/Suffix

Use a prefix or suffix when additional visual cues about an input's function may
be helpful.

Some fields have common visual patterns such as "search" having a magnifying
glass icon, "Select" having a downwards arrow, or currency inputs having a
currency symbol. These signifiers reinforce the purpose of the input to increase
[Recognition over Recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
and align the input with
[Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
With clearer guidance around the purpose of inputs, the user is able to better
focus on the task at hand. See
[InputFieldWrapper/Prefix and Suffix example](../?path=/story/components-private-inputfieldwrapper-mobile--prefix-and-suffix).
