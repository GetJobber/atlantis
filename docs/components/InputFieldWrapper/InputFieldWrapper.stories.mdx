# InputFieldWrapper

This component is used to wrap input fields such as
[InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext-docs--page) and
[InputPressable](../docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputpressable-docs--page)
to provide common patterns and functionality present in our input designs, such
as suffix/prefix icons, placeholders, etc.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Prefix/Suffix

Use a prefix or suffix when additional visual cues about an input's function may
be helpful.

Some fields have common visual patterns such as “search” having a magnifying
glass icon, “Select” having a downwards arrow, or currency inputs having a
currency symbol. These signifiers reinforce the purpose of the input to increase
[Recognition over Recall](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
and align the input with
[Consistency and Standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
With clearer guidance around the purpose of inputs, the user is able to better
focus on the task at hand. See
[InputFieldWrapper/Prefix and Suffix example](../?path=/story/components-private-inputfieldwrapper-mobile--prefix-and-suffix).

### Clearable

When setting `showClearAction` to `true` you must also provide an `onClear`
callback that will clear the input you are wrapping. See
[InputDate](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputdate-docs--page) and
[InputPressable](../docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputpressable-docs--page)
or [InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext-docs--page)
for examples.

See
[InputFieldWrapper/Clearable example](../?path=/story/components-private-inputfieldwrapper-mobile--clearable).
