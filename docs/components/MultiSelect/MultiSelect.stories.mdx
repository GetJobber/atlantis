# Multi Select

The MultiSelect component gives our users the possibility to select multiple
options from a menu.

## Design & usage guidelines

The goal of the MultiSelect component is to allow a user to check multiple
options within a list of items.

A user can click on the element to expand it and display the multiple options.
The element will display the selected options or the placeholder text if none
are selected.

Every time an option is checked or unchecked, a behavior can be triggered using
the `onOptionsChange` prop.

Adjusting the
[size](../?path=/story/components-selections-multiselect-web--sizes) of the
MultiSelect can be used to help align with common adjacent elements such as
[InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext--docs) or
[Select](../?path=/docs/components-selections-select--docs).

## Accessibility

The MultiSelect trigger element contains a downward-pointing-arrow to visually
hint that it can be expanded.

Features and behavior are announced to the user when using a screen reader.
