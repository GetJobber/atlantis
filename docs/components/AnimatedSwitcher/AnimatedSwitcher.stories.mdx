# AnimatedSwitcher

Smoothly switch between two components that aim to add delight when the user
interacts with them.

### AnimatedSwitcher.Icon

Animating between 2 icons is done in a more opinionated way where it would spin
from 1 icon to another. The animation reverses when you want to go back to the
initial icon. See
[AnimatedSwitcher/Icon example](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedswitcher-web--icon).
