# Spinner

Spinner is used to indicate the loading of content where the actual amount of
loading time or progress is unknown.

## Design & usage guidelines

The default Spinner size is `base` and can be used in most cases. The `small`
Spinner should be used on individual elements of an interface (e.g.
[Button](../?path=/docs/components-actions-button-docs--page) or
[Card](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card-docs--page)
contents) or when
[inline](../?path=/story/components-status-and-feedback-spinner-web--inline)
with content.

## Accessibility

The Spinner should announce itself to users of assistive technology such as
screenreaders.

The following built-in properties help Spinner convey its role effectively:

- `role="alert"` allows the Spinner to be announced as an alert feedback
  element.
- `aria-busy={true}` informs the user that the view is busy, setting the
  expectation that they cannot interact for the time being.
- `aria-label="loading"` reads out "Loading" to assistive tech, adding context
  as to _why_ the view is busy.

## Related components

If the amount of progress or loading time is known, use
[ProgressBar](../?path=/docs/components-status-and-feedback-progressbar-docs--page)
to give better context around the process.
