# Box

A box is a generic way to add structure to your page. Stop reaching for CSS
Modules to perform basic page layout, and instead use the Box component.

## Alpha State - Use Semantic Colours Please.

The Box component is currently in Alpha status. In particular, we intend to
fast-follow and restrict any non-semantic color usage. It was faster to roll
this component with the full colour set for now. We will remove the Alpha status
when we remove non-semantic colours, and we will warn developers when we do so.

## Design & Usage guidelines

A box is useful for wrapping content with a specific HTML5 element, and with
common Atlantis specific CSS styles. Box supports standard alignment, border,
borderColor, borderRadius, direction, gap, height, justification, margin,
overflow, padding, position, width and whitespace options.

A box should be used if your wrapping CSS styles can be achieved with a prop
configuration of the Box component. Some basic examples are below, all
configuration options are provided in the Basic Web example via the left-hand
navigation.

### No Props

<Canvas>
  <Box>
    This is Box without props. It marks your content as display: flex and
    flex-direction: column
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Base and Padding Base

<Canvas>
  <Box border="base" padding="base">
    By default you get no padding or borders, but with two 'base' props you can
    have both.
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Thick and Padding Large

<Canvas>
  <Box border="thick" padding="large">
    Standard paddings and margins are available, and different borders. This is
    using the 'thick' border along with padding 'large'
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Border Thickest and Margin Largest and Padding Extravagant

<Canvas>
  <Box margin="largest" border="thickest" padding="extravagant">
    Want a big margin and huge padding? Box has those too.
  </Box>
</Canvas>

## What about actual layout usages?

If you don't really want borders around everything but just want to lay out some
content on the page? You can do that too.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row">
    <Box padding="base" width="grow">
      Left
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" width="grow">
      Right
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### Maybe some custom heights or widths?

Box has those as well.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row" alignItems="center">
    <Box padding="base" width={350} border="base">
      Left, 350px wide
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" height={75} border="base">
      Right, 75px high
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### What about a gap between elements?

Standard sizes are supported.

<Canvas>
  <Box direction="row" alignItems="center" gap="large">
    <Box padding="base" width={50} border="base">
      Left, 50px wide
    </Box>
    <Box padding="base" height={25} border="base">
      Right, 25px high
    </Box>
  </Box>
</Canvas>

### I have specific border-left and margin-bottom requirements.

Box supports objects for some of its props, including padding and margin
"bottom, horizontal, left, right, top, vertical"

<Canvas>
  <Box padding={{ top: "large" }} border="thick">
    Top Padding?
  </Box>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Box margin={{ left: "large" }} border="base" padding="base">
    Left Margin?
  </Box>
</Canvas>
