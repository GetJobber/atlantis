# InputNumber2

InputNumber2 is used in forms that accept numbers as an answer.

## Design & usage guidelines

This is best suited for input data that benefits from being modified in
increments, such as quantity, price, or days (ie 2 days -> 3 days).

While some types of data may technically be numbers, they can be ill-suited for
using a number input. For example, phone numbers and credit card numbers provide
no value to the user by offering an incrementer.
