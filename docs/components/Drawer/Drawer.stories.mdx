# Drawer

Drawers are temporary sidebars that allow users to view supplementary content.
Users can interact with the main content while the drawer is visible.

## Related components

Use [SideDrawer](/components/SideDrawer) if you need to overlay the page's
content and block user interaction with the page, while still maintaining
visibilty of the page's primary contents.

Use [Modal](/components/Modal) if you need to overlay the page's content and
block user interaction with the page, and do not need the user to have visibilty
of the page's primary contents.

Use [Card](/components/Card) to group content inline, within the main view, in a
non-dismissible way.

## Accessibility

Drawer is built using an
[aside element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sections.html#the-aside-element) to
indicate to assistive technology that the content within the Drawer is

> tangentially related to the content of the parenting sectioning content, and
> which could be considered separate from that content. (W3 Org)

For drawer toggle elements, use `aria-controls` attribute on the trigger and an
`id` for the drawer element.

### DrawerGrid (Experimental)

A `DrawerGrid` wraps the content and the drawer component. It allows the content
to fill the available space when a user toggles the drawer.
