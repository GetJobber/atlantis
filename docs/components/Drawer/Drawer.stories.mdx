# Drawer

Drawers are temporary sidebars that allow users to view supplementary content.
Users can interact with the main content while the drawer is visible.

## Related components

Drawer is similar in some ways to Card and Modal.

For an experience where the user can only interact with one "mode" of content
(the main view _or_ the contents of the component) use
[Modal.](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-modal-docs--page)

For an inline grouping of content that is relevant within the main view and
non-dismissible, use
[Card.](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card-docs--page)

## Accessibility

Drawer is built using an
[aside element](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sections.html#the-aside-element) to
indicate to assistive technology that the content within the Drawer is

> tangentially related to the content of the parenting sectioning content, and
> which could be considered separate from that content. (W3 Org)

For drawer toggle elements, use `aria-controls` attribute on the trigger and an
`id` for the drawer element.

### DrawerGrid (Experimental)

A `DrawerGrid` wraps the content and the drawer component. It allows the content
to fill the available space when a user toggles the drawer.
