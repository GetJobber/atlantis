# DataList

DataList is used to show a collection list of similar items in a simpler manner
than [DataTable](?path=/story/components-lists-and-tables-datatable-docs--page).

It allows more control over the layout of the list items. It can also add
different layouts depending on the size of the screen that we support.

## Design & usage guidelines

While it's tempting to add a large amount of information to the DataList's
layout, it's important to keep in mind that the DataList is meant to be a simple
list of important items. We recommend not going over more than 5 data points per
item.

If you need to add more information, consider using the
[DataTable](?path=/story/components-lists-and-tables-datatable-docs--page)
component instead.
