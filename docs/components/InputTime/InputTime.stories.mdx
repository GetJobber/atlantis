# Input Time

The InputTime component is a text input that allows the user to enter a time
value.

## Design & usage guidelines

This component obeys the system locale settings to determine 24 or 12 hour time.

### States

A
[disabled](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-web--disabled)
state will be visually muted and the input will not be editable. This is similar
to the
[read-only](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-web--read-only)
state, but the input is not muted.

An [invalid](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-web--invalid)
state will indicate that the input is not valid. This can be used when the input
is required and the user has not entered a value.

## Controlled component

Web's
[Controlled](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-web--controlled)
version includes a type-ahead feature where typing at least 1 number
automatically fills in the rest of the time. For example, typing `2` will fill
in `2:00 PM` and typing `1` waits for a few milliseconds in case the user wants
to type `10`, `11`, or `12`.
