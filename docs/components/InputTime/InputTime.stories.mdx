# Input Time

The InputTime component is a text input that allows the user to enter a time
value.

## Design & usage guidelines

This component obeys the system locale settings to determine 24 or 12 hour time.

## Events

If the input starts empty the `ChangeEvent` isn't fired until a full time is
set. Setting just the hour or minute or _period_ (AM/PM) won't fire the event.
When the last element is set the change event will fire.
