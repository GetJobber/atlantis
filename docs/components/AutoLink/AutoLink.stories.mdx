# Auto Link

The AutoLink component is a base component that utilizes the
[autolinker](https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js/) package to find urls,
phone numbers and emails within a chunk of text. When these linkable items are
found, they are converted to links that can be interacted with.

This component makes use of the Text component to display both the plain text
and the links discovered.

In the event a phone number is pressed, after completing the call the user will
be returned to the app. The same applies when using the detected email.

## Usage guidelines

The AutoLink will detect linkable items within text and allow the user to
interact with them. You can use flags to determine if you want to ignore certain
types of links, such as ignoring phone numbers.

This is intended for scenarios where you do not know if the text to display will
contain links within it. A common use case for this would be when dealing with
user input.

## Notes

There is an [Autolink](https://github.com/joshswan/react-native-autolink)
package written by a third party that was investigated to accomplish what this
component does. Though we were able to provide our own rendering function to
display our own text instead of RN Text, this still required re-writing a good
chunk of functionality and still importing the base library to get the proper
types. Also contained extra things we didn't need. This package was used as
inspiration into dealing with this problem and building our own.
