# Form

The Form component is a wrapper component that handles the submission and
validation of forms.

For more information about `validations` using any of the Input components, see
the
[InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext--docs#validation-message)
documentation.

## Design & usages guidelines

The Form component has a lot of built-in features which rely on its internal
state. To take advantage of these features, do not bypass the Form's internal
state â€” the fields or inputs within the Form must have a `name` prop and **NOT**
have a `value` and `onChange` prop.

## Content guidelines

### Inputs

Form can accept various inputs and selection elements such as (but not limited
to) [InputText](/components/InputText), [Select](/components/Select),
[Switch](/components/Switch), [Checkbox](/components/Checkbox), and
[Chips](/components/Chips). They should be placed [Cards](/components/Card) to
indicate grouping when relevant, and groups of Cards can be spaced appropriately
using ContentSection.

### Save Button label

The `saveButtonLabel` property defaults to "Save", but should be made more
verbose to add context for the user. Use the format "Save \{object\}", such as
"Save Job". This helps clarify to the user that tapping the Save Button is not
saving the single input they are editing, but the entire object.

### Form errors

All error messaging should follow our
[Product Vocabulary.](/content/product-vocabulary)

## Accessibility (mobile)

The individual inputs are responsible for accessibility concerns such as the
labels, types, values, and error messages of each input.
