# Text

```ts
import { Text } from "@jobber/components-native";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Mobile"
    args={{
      children:
        '"640K is more memory than anyone will ever need on a computer" - Not Bill Gates',
    }}
  >
    {args => <Text {...args}>{args.children}</Text>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={Text} story="Mobile" />

## Supporting text

There's a `textSupporting` `level` that you can use to add an additional
content.

<Canvas>
  <Text level="textSupporting">
    Supporting Text should be used to supplement additional, more important
    content
  </Text>
</Canvas>

## Reverse theme

For the times when a text is added on a dark background.

<Canvas style={{ backgroundColor: "black" }}>
  <Text reverseTheme={true}>
    Changes Text color for display on a dark background
  </Text>
</Canvas>

## Notes

`Text` uses the core component [Text](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text) from
`react-native`.

### Copying text

There are a few caveats around copying text on Android and iOS that you can read
under the Typography documentation.
