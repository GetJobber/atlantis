# Side Drawer

SideDrawers are overlays that allow users to view or edit information while
maintaining visibilisty of the page's primary contents. Users cannot interact
with the page's contents while the SideDrawer overlay is open.

## Related components

Use [Drawer](/components/Drawer) if you need to allow users to view
supplementary content while still allowing users to interact with the main
contents of the page.

Use [Modal](/components/Modal) if you need to overlay the page's content and
block user interaction with the page, and do not need the user to have visibilty
of the page's primary contents.
