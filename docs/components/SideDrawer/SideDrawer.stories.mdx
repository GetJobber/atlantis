# Side Drawer

SideDrawers are overlays that allow users to view or edit information that
doesn't require a page to be built.

## Implementation guidelines

We're using a compound component pattern to separate the different parts of the
component. This allows us to have a more flexible component.

### Main wrapper

The `SideDrawer` component is the main component that holds everything.

<ArgsTable of={SideDrawer} />

### Title

The `SideDrawer.Title` component is used to show the title of the SideDrawer.
You can pass a:

- `string` to use the default styling of the title.
- `ReactElement` to customize the title. Keep in mind that you have to handle
  the styling of the title.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Title>My Title</SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```

Or

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Title>
    <Heading level={2} element="h3">
      My Title
    </Heading>
  </SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Actions

The `SideDrawer.Actions` component is used to render the actions next to the
close button. This accepts any component but it is meant to only be for
components that invoke an action.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Actions>
    <Button icon="add" ariaLabel="Add" />
  </SideDrawer.Actions>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Toolbar

The `SideDrawer.Toolbar` component is used to render the toolbar below the title
and have it be sticky. This is great for tools like search and filters that
stick to the top with the title. If your toolbar scrolls with the page, you can
just implement it as a direct child of the `SideDrawer`.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.Toolbar>
    <InputText placeholder="Search" />
  </SideDrawer.Toolbar>
</SideDrawer>
```

### Back Button

SideDrawer also comes with a back button that you can use and add to the UI
before the title. Use this when the user can navigate back to the previous
SideSheet content.

```tsx
<SideDrawer>
  <SideDrawer.BackButton onClick={handleClick} />
  <SideDrawer.Title>My Title</SideDrawer.Title>
</SideDrawer>
```

<ArgsTable of={SideDrawer.BackButton} />
