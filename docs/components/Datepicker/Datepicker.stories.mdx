# Date Picker

A `DatePicker` is used to allow a user to select a date from a visual calendar
interface.

While this component can be used in isolation, the intention is that in many
cases it will supplement an input component to provide the user with a
multi-mode opportunity to select a date.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Datepicker when you are looking to provide the user with a highly visual
interface for intuitive date selections.

A classic use case for a standalone Datepicker would be as a means to navigate
within a larger calendar interface.

It may be beneficial to supplement the Datepicker with alternate means of
entering their date selection, such as providing a `date` input.

### Inline

Use an inline Datepicker when you have sufficient space in the interface to have
a permanent date selection fixture, or when date selection is the primary
function of the interface, such as a stepped flow where the user is asked a
series of scheduling questions individually, in sequence.

In cases like complex scheduling forms where all the factors of a schedule such
as times, repeating frequency, and duration are being asked, consider using the
default popover-type behaviour for those use cases to reduce an overwhelming
volume of UI elements to process at once. See
[Inline](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--inline) example.

## Custom activator

If you want to use a different activator to display the `DatePicker` you can
pass a `React` component as the `activator`. See
[Custom Activator](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--custom-activator)
example.

## Restricting date ranges

If you want to enable for selection only a range of dates you can pass `minDate`
or `maxDate` to the component as props. See
[Date Range](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--min-date-max-date)
example.

## Highlighted dates

If you need to call attention to a series of dates on the calendar, the
`highlightDates` prop accepts an array of dates that will be displayed with
additional emphasis. See the
[Highlighted Dates](?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--restricted-date-range)
example.

## Accessibility

At this point, the `DatePicker` component is a wrapped version of
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/). This means that the
accessibility of the component is handled by the `React DatePicker` component.

Users can operate all of the controls by keyboard, including the `tab` to cycle
between Next/Previous month and the calendar, arrow keys to navigate between
dates, and `space` and/or `return` to make selections. Pressing `escape` will
close the Datepicker.

The date available for selection is read aloud to assistive technology in the
format "Choose {date} (button)". For example, "Choose December 1st, 2021
(button)".

If using a custom activator, ensure that the activator is keyboard-operable.

## Related components

- If you are looking to use the `DatePicker` in a `Form`, consider the
  [InputDate](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputdate-docs--page)
  component.
- For a time input, use
  [InputTime](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtime-docs--page)
- To present dates that have already been selected in a consistent format, use
  [FormatDate](../?path=/docs/components-utilities-formatdate-docs--page)
- To represent past or future dates and times, use
  [FormatRelativeDateTime](../?path=/docs/components-utilities-formatrelativedatetime--format-relative-date-time)

## Notes

As mentioned above, the Datepicker wraps
[React DatePicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/).
