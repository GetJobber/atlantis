# AnimatedPresence

Just like in real life, nothing appears out of nowhere. Animate elements that
get added or removed from the React tree with AnimatedPresence. If more than 1
element gets added, there will be a delay between each new element.

## Usage

### Conditional rendering

Hide and show elements with a transition to add emphasis on the change. This is
useful for UX which has a different part of the UI hidden until the user takes
an action to show them.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>{show && <div>Item</div>}</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the
[Basic](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--basic)
example for a live demo.

### List rendering

Animate items in a list as they are added or removed.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence>
  {items.map(item => (
    <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
  ))}
</AnimatedPresence>
```

See the [List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list)
example for a live demo.

### Animate on mount

Set the `initial` prop to `true` to animate the element whenever it initially
renders on the screen. See this in action on the
[List](../?path=/story/components-utilities-animatedpresence-web--list) example.

```tsx
<AnimatedPresence initial={true}>...</AnimatedPresence>
```

## Accessibility

AnimatedPresence respects the
[`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
setting. If the user has this enabled, the animations will be disabled and the
elements will show/hide instantly.
