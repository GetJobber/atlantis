# AnimatedPresence

Just like in real life, nothing appears out of nowhere. Animate elements that
get added or removed from the React tree with AnimatedPresence. If more than 1
element gets added, there will be a delay between each new element.

## Accessibility

AnimatedPresence respects the
[`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
setting. If the user has this enabled, the animations will be disabled and the
elements will show/hide instantly.
