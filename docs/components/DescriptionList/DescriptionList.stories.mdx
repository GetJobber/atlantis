# Description List

Description Lists are used to display a list of terms and descriptions.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Description List is a great solution when you have a small list of
information with a 1:1 label-to-data relationship. For example, the issued and
due dates on an invoice, or the job type, billing type and duration of a job.

## Related components

- To list more complex collections of related information, consider using a
  [List](/components/List).
- To display structured data for comparison, consider using a
  [Table](/components/Table).
