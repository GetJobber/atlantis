# Chip

Chip is a flexible component that can be used for 
- inline single- or multi-selection of items
- triggering filtering and selection components like [Combobox](../?path=/docs/components-selections-combobox--docs)
- presenting grouped items that can be added or removed

## Usage guidelines

Chip allows users to make selections in scenarios where space
is at a premium. It has three high-level usages: single-select, multi-select,
and add/dismiss selection.

### Single-select

If you need the user to make a selection of a single item from among several
items, and those items all have short (1–2 word) labels, single-select Chips
will allow the user to choose one of those items.

This preserves vertical space while allowing the user to clearly identify which
item they have selected.

Unlike [Radio](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-radiogroup--docs), the
selected single-select Chip can be de-selected by the user, leaving all
selections blank.

### Multi-select

If you need the user to make a selection of one _or more_ items from amongst
several items, and those items all have short (1–2 word) labels, a multi-select
Chips will allow the user to choose as many items from the group as they wish.

This preserves vertical space while allowing the user to clearly identify which
items they have selected. To signify to the user that multiple selections are
possible, a checkmark icon is present to reinforce the conceptual similarity to
a [Checkbox](../?path=/docs/components-selections-checkbox--docs).

Similar to Checkbox, a selected multi-select Chip can be de-selected by the
user, leaving all selections blank.

### Add/dismiss selection

When the user will be selecting one or more items by inputting their own Chip
options, use a dismissible Chip. Think of a case like team assignment, where
the user can add multiple users represented as Chips, and click on the dismiss
suffix of the Chip to remove a user.

The dismissible Chip allows them to remove previous selections from the Chips.
Use this option when the full list of possible selections is too great to
reasonably display in one group of Chip. For example, "all of my phone contacts"
would be far too many Chip options to present in one group, and would be
overwhelming for the user to interpret.

## Related components

- [Chips](../?path=/docs/components-selections-chips--docs) is a convenience wrapper
  that offers the single-select, multi-select, and add/dismiss functionality "out of the box"
- [Combobox](../?path=/docs/components-selections-combobox--docs) is most commonly
  triggered by a Chip, but is a separate component
- [Select](../?path=/docs/components-selections-select--docs) is a simpler single-select
  "dropdown" that presents as a form element and should be preferred in forms
- [RadioGroup](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-radiogroup--docs)
  should be used to allow the user to select "one-of-many" items (single-select)
  and the labels for the items are longer than 1 or 2 words.
- [Checkbox](../?path=/docs/components-selections-checkbox--docs) should be used
  to allow the user to select "one-or-more-of-many" items (multi-select) and the
  labels for the items are longer than 1 or 2 words.
- [InlineLabel](../?path=/docs/components-status-and-feedback-inlinelabel--docs)
  should be used when you just need a rounded-rectangular element that displays 
  metadata about an element

## Content guidelines

Chip labels should be 1–2 words at most. If any of the options in the group may
have longer labels, consider Checkbox or Radio as necessary for your selection
type.

## Accessibility

Chips should convey to the user whether it is a "checkbox" or "radio" element
based on single or multi-select. The Chips in this group have the appropriate
roles and keyboard operation to allow the user to interact as though they are
dealing with a checkbox or radio button.

If Chips is set for add/dismiss selections, the dismiss button should notify the
user that they will "dismiss \{label name\}" upon press.


## Responsiveness

The Chips themselves will take up as much space as their container allows, and
the Chips will flow left to right. Chips may re-flow into new rows, or scroll
out of view in a single row, depending on your use case.

Chip can truncate if its' container is limited in space, but does not inherently
cap its own width and will default to "hug" its contents.


## Notes

Chip is in the process of being applied to the more opinionated Chips convenience wrapper,
but by design does not carry the same level of "out of the box" functionality as it is a more
"atomic" element that can be used outside of those more complex selection flows.
