# Chip

Chip is cool.

<Chip label="hey" />

### Chip doesn't do much

<Chip label="Not Much." />

### Chip is accessible. Chip has a nice keyboard focus state.

<Chip label="You can tab to Chip. It's alright with Chip." />

## Chip has friends. Their names are Prefix and Suffix.

<Chip label="This is my friend Prefix.">
  <Chip.Prefix>
    <Avatar initials="st" size="small" />
  </Chip.Prefix>
</Chip>

<Chip label="This is my friend Suffix.">
  <Chip.Suffix>
    <Avatar initials="st" size="small" />
  </Chip.Suffix>
</Chip>

### Prefix and Suffix get along.

<Chip label="We're all friends here.">
  <Chip.Prefix>
    <Avatar initials="st" size="small" />
  </Chip.Prefix>

  <Chip.Suffix>
              <Icon name="cross" size="small" color="blue" />
  </Chip.Suffix>
</Chip>

### Chip can do some neat stuff. Like have a hat.

<Chip label="Well, a heading." heading="Hat"></Chip>

#### Or be subtle

<Chip label="I don't draw attention to myself." variation="subtle"></Chip>

#### Or wrong

<Chip label="Uh Oh" invalid></Chip>

#### Chip can also say no.

<Chip label="Nope." disabled></Chip>

#### Chip can't be both invalid and disabled though. Chip just won't show up.

<Chip label="Can't see me." disabled invalid></Chip>

# Even Friendlier Chips

Ever think to yourself, I just want a Chip that comes with built-in
selectability? Chip has you covered.

<ChipSelectable label="I'm selectable."></ChipSelectable>

Or how about a Chip that's ready to go away?

<ChipDismissible
  label="Ready to go. :)"
  onClick={() => alert("Atlantis wont remove Chip here. That is up to you.")}
></ChipDismissible>
