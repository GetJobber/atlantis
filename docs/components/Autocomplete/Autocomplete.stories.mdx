# Autocomplete

An Autocomplete component allows a user to quickly pick a preset value from a
larger list of possible options.

## Design & usage guidelines

The options in an Autocomplete component should be a list of possible values
that the user can select. These options should be presented in a way that makes
it easy for the user to find the value they are looking for. There are a few
ways to achieve this.

[Details](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-autocomplete-web--with-details)
can be added to an option, which will either appear below the option's label or
on the bottom right of the option. This can be used to provide more information
about the option, such as a description or a count.

[Section headings](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-autocomplete-web--section-heading)
can be added to an Autocomplete to break up the options into groups. This can be
useful if there are a lot of options or if the options are related to different
things.

You can
[set a value](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-autocomplete-web--set-a-value)
to the Autocomplete component by passing an active option. This will set the
`value` of the input.

Using the `getOptions` prop, you can pass a function that will be called when
the user types in the input. This async request should return a list of possible
options based on the user's input. This can be achieved by using either promises
or `await`.
