## Action Label

```ts
import { ActionLabel } from "@jobber/components-native";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="ActionLabel" args={{ children: "I am a label text" }}>
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable of={ActionLabel} />

### Font color variation

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Font color variation"
    parameters={{
      backgrounds: {
        default: "light",
      },
    }}
    args={{ variation: "learning", children: "Learning" }}
  >
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

As a best practice, do not design with disabled button states. This has negative
impacts on accessibility as well as an increase in complexity for users to
understand why the interface is disabled and how to resolve it.

With that said, if you can't design a flow without a disabled state, this is how
you disable an `ActionLabel`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Disabled" args={{ disabled: "true", children: "Disabled" }}>
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Alignment

The alignment of the text can be changed to your liking. However, this would
only work when the parent component/element adjusts the width of the
`ActionLabel` like `<View />`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Alignment" args={{ align: "center", children: "I am centered" }}>
    {args => (
      <View>
        <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>
      </View>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
