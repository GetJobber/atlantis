# Action Label

The `ActionLabel` is a base component that is widely used in areas that have an
`onPress` action, like a button.

The aim is to reduce the number of inconsistencies when a designer or an
engineer decides to build a pressable component that has text on it. This makes
it easier to maintain consistency in how we visually present tappable actions.

## Design & usage guidelines

`ActionLabel` supports similar semantic variations as Button:

- default (equivalent to "work")
- learning
- destructive
- subtle

with an additional variation of `onPrimary` which should be used when the
ActionLabel is consumed by a primary Button or other dark surface.
