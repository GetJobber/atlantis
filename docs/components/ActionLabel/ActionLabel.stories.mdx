# Action Label

The `ActionLabel` is a base component that is widely used in areas have an
`onPress` action, like a button.

The aim is to reduce the amount of inconsistencies when a designer or an
engineer decides to build pressable component that has a text on it. This makes
it easier to maintain consistency of how we visually present tappable actions.

```ts
import { ActionLabel } from "atlantis/ActionLabel";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="ActionLabel" args={{ children: "I am a label text" }}>
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={ActionLabel} story="ActionLabel" />

## Usage guidelines

`ActionLabel` supports similar semantic variations as Button:

- default (equivalent to "work")
- learning
- destructive
- subtle

with an additional variation of `onPrimary` which should be used when the
ActionLabel is consumed by a primary Button or other dark surface.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Font color variation"
    parameters={{
      backgrounds: {
        default: "light",
      },
    }}
    args={{ variation: "learning", children: "Learning" }}
  >
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

As a best practice, do not design with disabled button states. This has negative
impacts on accessibility as well as an increase in complexity for users to
understand why the interface is disabled and how to resolve it.

With that said, if you can't design a flow without a disabled state, this is how
you disable an `ActionLabel`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Disabled" args={{ disabled: "true", children: "Disabled" }}>
    {args => <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Alignment

The alignment of the text can be changed to your liking. However, this would
only work when the parent component/element adjusts the width of the
`ActionLabel` like `<View />`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Alignment" args={{ align: "center", children: "I am centered" }}>
    {args => (
      <View>
        <ActionLabel {...args}>{args.children}</ActionLabel>
      </View>
    )}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
