# Input Group

<Meta title="Components/Forms and Inputs/InputGroup/Docs" />

Use InputGroup to show a visual relationship between related input fields. If a
number of form fields, once submitted, make up a group of content (ie. an
address, or first and last name becoming a full name, start and end times of an
event) they are great candidates for an InputGroup.

## Nested example

The default layout is for fields to flow in a vertical direction, one above the
next. Use the `flowDirection` prop to specify when you want fields to flow in a
horizontal direction.

> **Note:** Nested `InputGroup` components need to be of
> `flowDirection="horizontal"` to avoid layout issues caused by nesting. Any
> non-horizontal nested groups will log an error to the console and not be
> rendered.

## Nested with Autocomplete

The
[Autocomplete component](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-autocomplete--autocomplete)
also works inside the `InputGroup`.
