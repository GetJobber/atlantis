# Input Currency

InputCurrency is a component that displays a currency input field with a
currency symbol.

## Design & usage guidelines

InputCurrency defaults to displaying a minimum of two decimal places and a
maximum of five places. If a user continues to try and enter numbers beyond the
`maxDecimalPlaces` default or set number, the component will automatically round
the value to the nearest two decimal places.

The users local currency can displayed to them by setting `showCurrencySymbol`
to true.
