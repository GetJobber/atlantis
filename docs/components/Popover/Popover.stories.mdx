# Popover

A Popover displays floating informative and actionable content positioned in
relation to a target. The Popover can contain content, media, or other
components.

## Usage guidelines

Some scenarios for Popover include the following:

### Related components

To add a menu button that presents multiple actions to the user, use
[Menu](../?path=/docs/components-navigation-menu--menu).

To add a hint about a UI element's function in a permanent fashion (ie revealing
a Button's label on hover), use
[Tooltip](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-tooltip--tooltip).

To add an inline informational element that the user can dismiss, consider if
[Banner](../?path=/docs/components-banner--banner) is the right fit for your use
case.

## Content guidelines

- Popover text content should be concise and clear. Try not to go over three
  lines so the user can get back to what they were doing!
- In "informational" usage, Popper may have a CTA that allows the user to
  "acknowledge" and dismiss the Popover; this does not replace the need for the
  dismiss button

## Accessibility

Popover has a role of `dialog` as it is an element that the user will be "in
dialogue" with, whether selecting an action, confirming acknowledgement, or
dismissing the Popover.

Depending on your use case, you may need to add focus management to your usage
of Popover; for example, if selecting a Button opens a Popover, you will want to
then set focus to the Popover, and if the user dismisses the Popover, return
focus to the button that opened the Popover.

If your element is effectively acting as an inline DOM element that the user
would otherwise encounter when traversing the page, this focus management may
not be necessary.

## Notes

- There is no componentized way to pass in actions for a "functional" Popover
  yet, but we have a good idea of what that would look like. We believe there
  may be some opportunity to share elements of Popover with Menu and vice-versa.
- There is no built-in focus management in Popover, as the specific
  implementation should drive those considerations
- Popover uses a plugin called [Popper](https://popper.js.org/react-popper/v2/)
  to power its' positioning
