# InputSearch

The InputSearch component allows the user to input a keyword to search from
associated data. It handles debouncing for improved performance when making
queries.

## Design & usage guidelines

InputSearch will provide a consistent experience for users searching for content
within the Jobber app. It uses familiar iconography and interactions to make
searching a simpler experience.

## Content guidelines

The label for InputSearch should help guide the user to find their results. It
can be helpful to direct the user to use certain types of queries for a given
search, such as "Search by clients and properties".

It is recommended to use the `search` icon as a prefix to aid users in
recognizing the functionality of the input.

InputSearch will take up the full available width of its container.

## Accessibility

Most of the accessibility concerns for InputSearch are handled by `InputText`.
It is announced as an input and the label and value are read to assistive
technology. Users can navigate to the clear button to remove the entered value.
