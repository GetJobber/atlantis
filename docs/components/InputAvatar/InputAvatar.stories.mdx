# Input Avatar

The InputAvatar component is used to allow users to change their Avatar. This is
an **experimental** component and should be used with careful consideration.

## Design & usage guidelines

InputAvatar requires a `getUploadParams` telling it where and how to upload the
avatar. You can read more about `getUploadParams` in the
[InputFile](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputfile-docs--page#getuploadparams)
component.
