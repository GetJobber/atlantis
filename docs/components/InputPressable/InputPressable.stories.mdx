# Input Pressable

InputPressable is a component that is used to trigger an action when pressed.

## Design & usage guidelines

This component matches InputText in terms of visual design, but functionality is
tied to a press action instead of an input. As a result, this component can
launch a native modal or external library such as the DateTimePicker, instead of
acting as an input that triggers a keyboard when tapped.

### States

A
[disabled](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputpressable-mobile--disabled)
InputPressable cannot be pressed and is visually muted to indicate that it is
disabled.

An
[invalid](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputpressable-mobile--invalid)
state is indicated by a red input line and an error message. The error message
is displayed below the input.

To make an InputPressable
[clearable](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputpressable-mobile--clearable)
you need to pass the `clearable` prop set as `always`. The reason for this is
that InputPressable isn't an input that is focused in the same way an InputText
would be. When you want to have an input be clearable you will also need to
provide an `onClear` that will clear the input's value.
