# Input Pressable

InputPressable is a component that is used to trigger an action when pressed.

## Design & usage guidelines

This component matches InputText in terms of visual design, but functionality is
tied to a press action instead of an input. As a result, this component can
launch a native modal or external library such as the DateTimePicker, instead of
acting as an input that triggers a keyboard when tapped.

InputPressable can only be used as a controlled component. Given the nature of
this input component which requires a wrapper to set the value, it doesn't make
sense for this component to be uncontrolled.

To make an InputPressable clearable you need to pass the `clearable` prop set as
`always` the reason for this is that InputPressable isn't an input that is
focused in the same way an InputText would be. When you want to have an input be
clearable you will also need to provide an `onClear` that will clear the input's
value.
