# Confirmation Modal

<Meta title="Components/Overlays/ConfirmationModal" />

A ConfirmationModal allows users to confirm or cancel actions that they are
performing. Examples of actions that may need confirmation are navigating off an
edited page or deleting an object.

## Design & usage guidelines

ConfirmationModal should be used to confirm or cancel an action the user is
performing.

If the user is confirming an action that will destroy, delete, or remove
something, use a
[destructive](../?path=/story/components-overlays-confirmationmodal-web--destructive)
ConfirmationModal to visually reinforce the potential consequences.

In some instances, such as when dealing with a collection of items with common
actions, you may want to place a single ConfirmationModal on a page and then
call to open it when required for each action. We can do this by using the
`confirmationModalRef` which exposes a `show` method, allowing you to present a
confirmation modal on demand. In the
[Controlled](../?path=/story/components-overlays-confirmationmodal-web--controlled)
example, we have an array of users and then render a button for each that
presents a confirm modal.

## Content guidelines

Keep language in a ConfirmationModal clear, concise, and consistent.

Verbs in the title should directly relate to the `confirmLabel`.

| **✅ Do**                    | **❌ Don't**        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Discard unsaved changes?** | **Cancel editing?** |
| Cancel / Discard             | No / Yes            |

Only use **Cancel** as a label to allow the user to exit the current action.

| **✅ Do**             | **❌ Don't**            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stop file upload?** | **Cancel file upload?** |
| Cancel / Stop         | Exit / Cancel           |

Avoid using generic or verbose titles.

| **✅ Do**                                           | **❌ Don't**                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delete job #2121?**                               | **Are you sure?**                                   |
| Deleting this job will remove all associated visits | Deleting this job will remove all associated visits |
| Cancel / Delete Job                                 | Cancel / Delete Job                                 |
