# Confirmation Modal

<Meta title="Components/Overlays/ConfirmationModal/Docs" />

A ConfirmationModal allows users to confirm or cancel actions that they are
performing. Examples of actions that may need confirmation are navigating off an
edited page or deleting an object.

## Design & usage guidelines

`ConfirmationModals` should be used to confirm or cancel an action the user is
performing.

Keep language in a `confirmationModal` clear, concise, and consistent.

Verbs in the title should directly relate to the `confirmLabel`.

| **✅ Do**                    | **❌ Don't**        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Discard unsaved changes?** | **Cancel editing?** |
| Cancel / Discard             | No / Yes            |

Only use **Cancel** as a label to allow the user to exit the current action.

| **✅ Do**             | **❌ Don't**            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stop file upload?** | **Cancel file upload?** |
| Cancel / Stop         | Exit / Cancel           |

Avoid using generic or verbose titles.

| **✅ Do**                                           | **❌ Don't**                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delete job #2121?**                               | **Are you sure?**                                   |
| Deleting this job will remove all associated visits | Deleting this job will remove all associated visits |
| Cancel / Delete Job                                 | Cancel / Delete Job                                 |

## Controlled Confirmation Modal

In some instances, such as when dealing with a collection of items with common
actions, you may want to place a single Confirmation Modal on a page and then
call to open it when required for each action.

We can do this by using the `confirmationModalRef` which exposes a `show` method
which allows you to present a confirmation modal on demand.

In the example below we have an array of users and then render a button for each
that presents a confirm modal.

## Destructive

If the user is confirming an action that will destroy, delete, or remove
something, use a destructive ConfirmationModal to visually reinforce the
potential consequences.

## Related components

- To present non-blocking, contextual, text-only content, use a
  [Tooltip](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-tooltip--tooltip).
- To simply present information for users to view, edit, or for a temporary
  change of context, use a regular
  [Modal](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-modal--modal).
