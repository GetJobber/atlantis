# Progress Bar

A ProgressBar is a visual indicator of how close something is to completion.

## Design & usage guidelines

The ProgressBar should be used to show "definite" progress; we know exactly how
close the process is to completion. For "indefinite" progress, where we may not
know exactly how much longer something might take, use a
[Spinner](..?path=/docs/components-status-and-feedback-spinner--docs).

Some great use cases for a ProgressBar include:

- Setup wizard, where we know how many steps the user has completed and how many
  steps remain.
- File uploads, where we know the total file size and how much data has already
  been sent.

An example where you might be better served using a Spinner:

- Loading a calendar within a view, where we do not know it's "complete" until
  there's no more data left to load.
