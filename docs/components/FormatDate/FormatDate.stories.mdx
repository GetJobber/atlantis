# FormatDate

<Meta title="Components/Utilities/FormatDate/Docs" />

In Jobber a FormatDate is used to ensure that the date is displayed in the
expected format. No text styling is applied, this simply formats the date.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Getting a string version

Use `strFormateDate` if you need your formatted date as a string so it can be
passed as an attribute that doesn't allow for a component.

```ts
import { strFormatDate } from "@jobber/components/FormatDate";
```

<Canvas>
  <Text>{strFormatDate(new Date())}</Text>
</Canvas>

## Design & usage guidelines

Use FormatDate to ensure that a date is represented as expected.

If there are additional text styling concerns, wrap FormatDate in a
[Text](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-text-docs--page) component.

If the formatted date is intended to be part of a heading, wrap FormatDate in a
[Heading](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-heading--heading)
component.

If you require a string instead of a component use strFormatDate.
