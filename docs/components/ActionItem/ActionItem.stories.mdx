# ActionItem

ActionItem allows for consistent presentation of text content that can be
actioned on. It can use icons to provide additional visual context about the
text content.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <ActionItem icon="work" onPress={() => alert("👍")}>
      <Text level={"textSupporting"}>Service Checklist</Text>
    </ActionItem>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Usage guidelines

ActionItem will provide a familiar pattern for enhancing text content with icons
and providing actions.

## Related components

To group multiple ActionItems together with dividers between them, use
ActionItemGroup.

ActionItem is commonly consumed by
[Card](/docs/atlantis-layouts-and-containers-card--card). In most cases, it will
also render at least one [Icon](/docs/atlantis-images-and-icons-icon--icon).

If you need to generate a longer list of consistently-formatted content,
consider using [List.](/docs/atlantis-lists-list--list)

## Content guidelines

ActionItem provides a pre-styled "title", which can be used to consistently
title the element.

Child content can be whatever you need, but typically consists of either Text or
TitledDetail.

## Accessibility

The Icons in ActionItem should not be announced to assistive technology. Similar
to a ListItem, the entire contents of the ActionItem should be read as one
element.

## Responsiveness

ActionItem takes up the full available width of its parent. The title will
reflow to a new line, while the icons remain aligned on the leading and trailing
ends.

The child content will use the responsive behviour of its respective components.
