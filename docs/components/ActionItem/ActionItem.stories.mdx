# Action Item

ActionItem allows for consistent presentation of text content that can be
actioned on. It can use icons to provide additional visual context about the
text content.

## Design & usage guidelines

The ActionItem will provide a familiar pattern for enhancing text content with
icons and providing actions.

ActionItem is commonly used
[in a Card](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem-mobile--in-a-card),
where it can be grouped with other ActionItems or other elements as needed.

If the action appears directly related to the title, or otherwise is not
well-suited to be centered in the ActionItem, you can
[align the action](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem-mobile--action-alignment)
as needed.

## Content guidelines

ActionItem provides a pre-styled `title`, which can be used to consistently
title the element. You can use the
[title](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitem-mobile--title-only)
and not pass any children. This is useful when you have empty states that
require the user's attention.

When an `onPress` is provided, the entire ActionItem is tappable for easy
interactivity. If a child of the ActionItem has an `onPress`, tapping directly
on that child will trigger the child item's `onPress`.

Child content can be whatever you need but typically consists of
[Text](../?path=/docs/components-text-and-typography-text--docs).

## Related components

To group multiple ActionItems together with dividers between them, use
[ActionItemGroup](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-actionitemgroup--docs).

ActionItem is commonly consumed by
[Card](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-card--docs). In most
cases, it will also render at least one
[Icon](../?path=/docs/components-images-and-icons-icon--docs).

## Accessibility

The Icons in ActionItem should not be announced to assistive technology. The
entire contents of the ActionItem should be read as one element.
