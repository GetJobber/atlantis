# Grid

Helps create a layout that conforms to a 12-point grid system.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Grid is divided up into 12 columns. The `Grid.Cell` child sets how many of
the 12 columns it takes as a width via `size`. The `Grid.Cell` also includes
breakpoints of `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl`. Those sizes strictly follow our
[Design Breakpoints](../?path=/docs/design-breakpoints--docs).

As an example, let's say you have a
[three column grid](../?path=/story/components-layouts-and-structure-grid-web--three-columns)
that goes side by side with a 50/25/25 split on medium-sized screens and up.
But, on a small-sized screen, it stacks on top of each other.

The way you'd achieve that is to:

- Set the `Grid.Cell` child to have a size for `xs` and `md`
  - example: `{ xs: number, md: number }`
- All `xs` would be set to `12` so it fills the whole width and automatically
  stacks on extra-small and small screens
- The `md` would then get
  - `6` on Column 1
  - `3` on Column 2
  - `3` on Column 3
- If you sum up the values for `md`, you'd get 12.
  - If you set the last column to be 4, it'll sum up to 13 and pushes that last
    column down

### Visualizing the grid lines

If you use a Chromium browser like Google Chrome, Arc, or Safari, you can follow
Chrome's
[Inspect CSS grid layouts](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css/grid/)
by using the dev tools.
