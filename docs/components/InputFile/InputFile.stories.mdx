# Input File

<Meta title="Components/Forms and Inputs/InputFile" />

InputFile allows users to upload a file, or multiple files by dragging and
dropping them into an area on the page or by clicking a button.

## Design & usage guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the InputFile component, consider the
following:

- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.

### getUploadParams

`getUploadParams` is a necessary callback that tells InputFile where and how to
upload files that are passed to it. It must return an object conforming to the
`UploadParams` interface. `getUploadParams` can be async, allowing for a network
request to fetch any extra fields.

```ts
interface UploadParams {
  /**
   * Url to POST file to.
   */
  readonly url: string;

  /**
   * Key to identify file.
   * If unspecified a random `uuid` will be used.
   */
  readonly key?: string;

  /**
   * Any extra fields to send with the upload POST.
   * If unspecified only the file will be included.
   */
  readonly fields?: { [field: string]: string };
}
```

### updateFiles helper

InputFile also exports an `updateFiles` method. This method allows for easily
updating an array of `FileUpload`s based on their `key` as uploads progress.

```ts
/**
 * Upsert a given `FileUpload` into an array of `FileUpload`s.
 * `key` is used to uniquely identify files.
 *
 * @param updatedFile FileUpload File that was updated.
 * @param files Existing array of FileUploads.
 * @returns FileUpload[] updated set of files.
 */
export function updateFiles(updatedFile: FileUpload, files: FileUpload[]);
```

### validator

InputFile can accept a `validator` function as a prop. This will allow you to
reject or accept file uploads based on your needs. The value of the function
must accept a File and return `null` when it is accepted or an error object when
rejected.

For example, the code below only accepts files that are less than 2MB in size.
Take a look at the
[File Size Validator](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputfile-web--file-size-validator)
story for expected behavior.

```ts
function fileSizeValidator(file: File) {
  if (file.size > 2000000) {
    return {
      code: "file-too-big",
      message: "The file is too big. Try using a smaller image",
    };
  }

  return null;
}
```

### maxFiles

The `maxFiles` property in the InputFile component is used to specify the
maximum number of files that can be uploaded via the dropzone. This property is
part of the `maxFilesValidation` object, which also includes the
`numberOfCurrentFiles` property to track the number of files that have already
been uploaded. When the total number of uploaded files exceeds the `maxFiles`
limit, the component will display a validation message and prevent additional
files from being uploaded.

The
[Max Files Limit](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputfile-web--max-files-limit)
example demonstrates the behaviour of uploading more than `maxFiles`.

```ts
 <InputFile
    ...
    onUploadComplete={handleUpload}
    maxFilesValidation={{ maxFiles: 3, numberOfCurrentFiles: files.length }}
  />
```

`maxFiles` is directly mapped to `react-dropzone`'s `maxFiles` prop, documented
[here](https://react-dropzone.js.org/#!/Accepting%20specific%20number%20of%20files).

### description

The `description` prop is a string that can be used to provide additional
information to the user. A common use case is to provide the accepted file types
and maximum size for each file. With a helpful `description`, users are more
aware of the limitations and requirements of the file upload.

### allowedTypes

The `allowedTypes` prop determines the types of files that can be uploaded.
`allowedTypes` accepts `images`, `basicImages` or an array of customized file
types. If the `allowedTypes` prop is not provided, all types will be accepted.

Using the `FileTypes` enum, you can customize the types of files that are
allowed to be uploaded.

```ts
<InputFile
  ...
  allowedTypes={["JPEG", "PNG", "HEIC", "PDF", "DOCX"]}
/>
```

### name & value

InputFile includes a hidden input element to enable seamless integration with
form submissions.

The `name` prop defines the key under which the uploaded file data is submitted
in the form.

The `value` prop contains an array of `FileUpload` objects, which represent the
files that have been uploaded.

When the form is submitted, the file data stored in the value prop is serialized
into a JSON string and included in the hidden input with the specified name.
This ensures the data is submitted as part of the form in a format that is easy
to parse and use.

## Notes

If you would like to restrict specific file types, it is advised that you use
the `allowedTypes` property instead of the `validator` property.
