# Input File

<Meta title="Components/Forms and Inputs/InputFile/Docs" />

InputFile allows users to upload a file, or multiple files by dragging and
dropping them into an area on the page or by clicking a button.

## Design & usage guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the InputFile component, consider the
following:

- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.

### getUploadParams

`getUploadParams` is a necessary callback that tells InputFile where and how to
upload files that are passed to it. It must return an object conforming to the
`UploadParams` interface. `getUploadParams` can be async, allowing for a network
request to fetch any extra fields.

```ts
interface UploadParams {
  /**
   * Url to POST file to.
   */
  readonly url: string;

  /**
   * Key to identify file.
   * If unspecified a random `uuid` will be used.
   */
  readonly key?: string;

  /**
   * Any extra fields to send with the upload POST.
   * If unspecified only the file will be included.
   */
  readonly fields?: { [field: string]: string };
}
```

### updateFiles helper

InputFile also exports an `updateFiles` method. This method allows for easily
updating an array of `FileUpload`s based on their `key` as uploads progress.

```ts
/**
 * Upsert a given `FileUpload` into an array of `FileUpload`s.
 * `key` is used to uniquely identify files.
 *
 * @param updatedFile FileUpload File that was updated.
 * @param files Existing array of FileUploads.
 * @returns FileUpload[] updated set of files.
 */
export function updateFiles(updatedFile: FileUpload, files: FileUpload[]);
```
