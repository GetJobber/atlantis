# Calendar Date Picker

A `CalendarDatePicker` is used to allow a user to select date(s) or a date range
from a visual calendar interface.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use Datepicker when you are looking to provide the user with a highly visual
interface for date selections.

A classic use case for a standalone Datepicker would be as a means to navigate
within a larger calendar interface.

## Restricting date ranges

If you want to enable for selection only a range of dates you can pass `minDate`
or `maxDate` to the component as props. See
[Date Range](../?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--min-date-max-date)
example.

## Highlighted dates

If you need to call attention to a series of dates on the calendar, the
`highlightDates` prop accepts an array of dates that will be displayed with
additional emphasis. See the
[Highlighted Dates](?path=/story/components-selections-datepicker-web--restricted-date-range)
example.

## Accessibility

Users can operate all of the controls by keyboard, including the `tab` to cycle
between Next/Previous month and the calendar, arrow keys to navigate between
dates, and `space` and/or `return` to make selections.

The date available for selection is read aloud to assistive technology in the
format "Choose {date} (button)". For example, "Choose December 1st, 2021
(button)".
