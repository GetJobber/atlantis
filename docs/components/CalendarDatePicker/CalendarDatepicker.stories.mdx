# Calendar Date Picker

A `CalendarDatePicker` is used to allow a user to select date(s) or a date range
from a visual calendar interface.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use CalendarDatepicker when you are looking to provide the user with a highly
visual interface for date selections.

A classic use case for a standalone CalendarDatepicker would be as a means to
navigate within a larger calendar interface.

## Restricting date ranges

If you want to enable for selection only a range of dates you can pass `minDate`
or `maxDate` to the component as props. See
[this example](?path=/story/components-selections-calendardatepicker-web--basic)

## Highlighted dates

If you need to call attention to a series of dates on the calendar, the
`highlightDates` prop accepts an array of dates that will be displayed with
additional emphasis. See
[this example](?path=/story/components-selections-calendardatepicker-web--basic)

## Localization

Internally the component makes use of `navigator.language` +
`Intl.DateTimeFormat` to format and display dates. The `weekStartsOnMonday` prop
can be used to change the first day of the week to Monday. Textual translations
can be provided using the `translations` prop.

## Accessibility

Users can operate all of the controls by keyboard, including the `tab` to cycle
between Next/Previous month and the calendar, arrow keys to navigate between
dates, and `space` and/or `return` to make selections.

Page up and page down keys can be used to navigate between months or, when
adding shift key, navigate between years.

The _onChange_ callback also provides you with information about via what method
a selection was made. This supports cases where the _CalendarDatePicker_ is
rendered inside a dialog or modal and should close when selecting a date using
the _Enter_ key.

The date available for selection is read aloud to assistive technology in the
format "Choose {date} (button)". For example, "Choose December 1st, 2021
(button)".
