# InputPhoneNumber

Automatically format your user's phone number as they type.

InputPhoneNumber's auto-format is set to always be `(***) ***-****` and doesn't
expect the user to type in their country code. Because phone numbers vary so
much around the world, typing more than 10 digits will turn off the
auto-formatting.

## Design & Usage guidelines

Due to the auto-format, this component is restricted to only be used as a
controlled component. That means the `value` and `onChange` props are required,
unlike the other input components.

## Content guidelines

The `prefix` prop can be used to add a
[country code](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputphonenumber-web--with-country-code)
to the input. The country code won't be added to the value that the component
would return. It is simply for visual purposes.

InputPhoneNumber can also have a
[custom pattern](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputphonenumber-web--custom-pattern)
if you wish to use a different format for the phone number.

Lastly, InputPhoneNumber will respect the format of the
[initial value](../?path=/story/components-forms-and-inputs-inputphonenumber-web--initial-value)
it is given. It will only start auto-formatting the existing value when the user
edits the input.
