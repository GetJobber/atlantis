# Light Box

LightBox is a component designed to display an array of images to the user. A
user clicks on a control and is shown a carousel style presentation of the
defined images.

## Design & usage guidelines

The LightBox's primary goal is to allow users to see a high resolution view of
images contained within the page they're viewing. The application of a LightBox
facilitates smaller thumbnail images to be used in an interface without
compromising the detail within.

The LightBox should only be used when displaying an image at a greater scale is
the primary function of opening it. Additional content types would be better
suited by using a dialogue or alternative method.

### OnRequestClose

This function receives the index of the last image the user viewed before
closing the LightBox component with the lastPosition key. This might we useful
if we want to return information about the final state when closed (e.g. for
analytics).
