# Link

<Meta title="Components/Text and Typography/Link/Docs" />

The Link will render an `<a>` tag with the appropriate `href` and `target`
attributes, when/as applicable.

## Usage guidelines

A Link marked external will always open in a new tab. Set this when linking away
from Jobber or to other applications or sites across Jobber where this behaviour
is appropriate (e.g. linking from Jobber Online to the Jobber Help Center).

Link should not be used to submit form data, trigger actions, or alter the state
of the page. Use a [Button](../?path=/docs/components-actions-button-docs--page)
for these purposes.

## Content guidelines

Contents of the link should be textual, and may include some formatting features
(e.g. italic text for emphasis may be appropriate, changing the inherited
underline probably isn't). The text can be plain, from a `Typography` component,
a `format`(`Date|Time|Email`) component or similar. Don't use this component to
wrap other kinds of UI elements to make them clickable.

## Accessibility

Try to ensure the text of the Link is descriptive of the destination. Avoid
using "click here" or "learn more" as the text of the link, and instead use the
title of the destination page or a short description of the content.

If it's not possible to make the visible text sufficiently descriptive without
additional context, set the `ariaLabel` prop to a descriptive string for
screenreaders. Do _not_ set this prop if it will be redundant to the link text.
