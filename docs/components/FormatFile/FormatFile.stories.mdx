# Format File

FormatFile will take a file object and display it in a number of lifecycle
states. It can be used to display a file that has been uploaded, or to display a
file that is about to be uploaded, as indicated by the progress indicator.

## Design & usage guidelines

When contributing to, or consuming the FormatFile component, consider the
following:

- FormatFile components should take up the full width of the parent container (1
  or 2 files per row)
- The delete button will only be displayed if the callback function is passed in
- Files can be displayed as either an expanded or compact FormatFile
