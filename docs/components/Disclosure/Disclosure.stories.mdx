# Disclosure

Disclosure is a component that allows users to progressively reveal content that
is not essential to the primary objective of a given view.

## Design & usage guidelines

Disclosure is useful for revealing or hiding content that is not essential for
the user to view all at once. You may want to put content inside of a Disclosure
to:

- reduce distractions or avoid overwhelming the user
- hide non-critical controls or options in a form

Disclosure should only be used to contain content or controls that aren't
required for the user to complete the primary objective of a given view.

For example, if a user has to make a selection between two options to complete a
task, do not put the selection controls in a Disclosure. A better example of
using a Disclosure would be if there is an optional setting that a user may want
to change but is not required to.

## Content guidelines

- `title` should be informative and label the type of content grouped in the
  body of the Disclosure
- `children` should be actionable and clear. The contents of a Disclosure can
  be:
  - plain text
  - any React component (except
    [Page](../?path=/docs/components-layouts-and-structure-page-docs--page) and
    [Table](../?path=/docs/components-lists-and-tables-table-docs--page))

## Accessibility

- Users should be able to use their keyboard and toggle the component's
  open/close state
- Headings are permitted in `summary` elements to provide in-page navigational
  assistance
- Include aria-expanded attribute on the trigger to communicate to assistive
  technology
- Include aria-controls attribute ties on the trigger to the content it controls
  using the id of the collapsible container
- The trigger contains a downward-pointing-arrow to hint that it can be
  expanded. When the disclosure item is in an expanded state, this is rotated
  180 degrees to point upwards
- The icon will be given an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute to hide it from
  assistive technologies, as well as `focusable="false"` to address an
  inconsistency in IE and older versions of Edge

### Responsiveness

The Disclosure component should handle both click and touch, as well as keyboard
inputs. It should fill the width of its container and if the component is less
than 375px wide, the title will wrap and should not be truncated.
