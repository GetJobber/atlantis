# Input Password

InputPassword is used to display a secure password input field.

## Design & usage guidelines

Use InputPassword for authentication flows where the user is required to enter a
password.

If you are building an experience for authentication that does not require
character-masking or are looking for more information regarding `validations`,
refer to
[InputText](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-inputtext-docs--page#validation-message).
