# BottomSheet

BottomSheet uses an overlay to focus attention to the user on the options
available after triggering a button. This helps isolate the decision-making that
a user has to make at each step of their interaction. BottomSheet is used to
bring up a modal from the bottom that will contain whatever children are passed
to it. Its height will be defined by the component that is passed to it.

BottomSheet uses an internal BottomSheetOption to provide a preset pairing of an
Icon and an ActionLabel.

By default, the `<BottomSheet />` is not visible on the screen. To open the
`<BottomSheet />`, you need to add a `ref` attribute on it and call
`ref.current.open()`.

## Usage guidelines

For the most part, a BottomSheet will be used in cases where the user is
choosing from a menu offering additional functionality related to onscreen
items.

In certain scenarios, you may need to add a title or an explicit option to
cancel the BottomSheet.

### onClose

Do not use `ref.current?.close()` inside the onClose callback. This could create
an infinite loop.

### Cancel

A **cancel action** should only be used in cases where:

- an action will _actually_ be cancelled; if the only thing tapping "cancel"
  will do is close the BottomSheet, don't use cancel
- it is not inherently obvious that tapping out of the BottomSheet will _not_
  complete the desired preceding action initiated

### Heading

Add a **heading** to the BottomSheet in cases where the user has initiated a
preceding action which could result in a state change. In this case, the title
should repeat the preceding action label.

## Content guidelines

BottomSheetOption follows the same content guidelines as the web
