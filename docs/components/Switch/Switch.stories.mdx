# Switch

A Switch toggles the state of a single setting to on or off.

## Design & usage guidelines

The Switch is a useful component for manipulating settings with binary
(true/false, yes/no, on/off) conditions. For this reason its' label is limited
to ON/OFF.

### Switches, Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

A Switch, a
[Checkbox](../?path=/docs/components-selections-checkbox-docs--page), and a pair
of
[RadioButton](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-radiogroup-docs--page)
can seem similar in theory, as all can represent an `either/or decision` for the
user. Use a Switch when the user must make a decision to turn something on or
off, and a single Checkbox when a user is opting in to a choice. A pair of
RadioButtons can be used to help the user decide between two discrete options,
such as “fixed price” and “per visit” invoicing options.

## Disabled

A disabled switch cannot be operated by the user. If presenting a disabled "On"
switch to the user, provide a clear description for the user on how to enable
the switch to avoid creating a sense that the user has lost control of the
interface.
