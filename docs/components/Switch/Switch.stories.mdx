# Switch

A switch toggles the state of a single setting to on or off.

## Design & usage guidelines

The switch is a useful component for manipulating settings with binary
(true/false, yes/no, on/off) conditions. For this reason its' label is limited
to ON/OFF.

### Switches, Checkboxes and Radio Buttons

A switch, a checkbox, and a pair of radio buttons can seem similar in theory, as
all can represent an `either/or decision` for the user. Use a switch when the
user must make a decision to turn something on or off, and a single checkbox
when a user is opting in to a choice. A pair of radio buttons can be used to
help the user decide between two discrete options, such as “fixed price” and
“per visit” invoicing options.

## Disabled

A disabled switch cannot be operated by the user. If presenting a disabled "On"
switch to the user, provide a clear description for the user on how to enable
the switch to avoid creating a sense that the user has lost control of the
interface.

  <Switch value={false} ariaLabel="Visible to clients" disabled={true} />
