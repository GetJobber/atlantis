# Radio Group

RadioGroup will allow users to choose a single selection from one of a list of
provided options.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Rendering RadioOption with children

If the `RadioGroup` is being used to select something other then text, you can
render the `RadioOptions` with `children`.

## Accessibility

**Note:** When using `children` without a `label` it is the responsibility of
the child to supply the proper accessible labels. If you are using children that
do not contain text, an `aria-label` should be provided.
