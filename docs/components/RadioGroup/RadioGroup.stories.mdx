# Radio Group

RadioGroup will allow users to choose a single selection from one of a list of
provided options.

## Usage guidelines

### Rendering RadioOption with children

If the `RadioGroup` is being used to select something other then text, you can
render the `RadioOptions` with `children`.

**Note:** When using `children`, `label` and `description` are not allowed due
to the fact that they would collide with the `children` prop.

## Accessibility

**Note:** When using `children` it is the responsibility of the child to supply
the proper accessible labels. If you are using children that do not contain
text, an `aria-label` should be provided.
