# Button


## Summary

Buttons are a core user interface component. They allow service providers (SPs) to initiate, complete, 
or reverse actions such as submitting forms, triggering workflows, or navigating between screens.
At Jobber, Buttons empower SPs to complete work quickly and confidently, whether they're logging in, 
saving a job, or taking action from a modal.

The right button to use depends on:

- The type of action the SP is attempting to complete
- The hierarchy of the interface the button lives in


## Anatomy

A Button typically includes:

- Label (required): Clear, concise verb describing the action  
- Icon (optional): Reinforces meaning or improves scanability  


## Behaviour

Buttons should be easy to find and easy to use. They should 
appear near the thing they affect, or in a place that makes 
sense for the next step.

- In modals: Buttons usually sit at the bottom right. The main 
action comes last, and cancel is placed before it.

- On pages: Buttons should line up with related content, like 
form fields or cards. Avoid placing actions too far away from 
the thing they’re acting on.

- When tapped or clicked: buttons should respond right away.
Changing state to show that something is happening. If an 
action takes time, use a loading state so SPs know it’s in 
progress and don’t tap again by mistake.

Buttons don’t dismiss things unless they’re meant to. If tapping 
a button closes a modal or banner, that should feel intentional rather
than surprising.

#### Sizes

Buttons come in three sizes. `Base` is the default and should be used for almost
every use case.

Only use `large` for extremely spacious interfaces such as a login form, and
`small` when the interface has extremely tight size constraints.

    <Content>
      <Button label="Small" size="small" />

      <Button label="Base" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Large" size="large" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

#### Disabled Buttons

As a best practice, do not design with disabled button states. This has negative
impacts on accessibility as well as an increase in complexity for users to
understand why the interface is disabled and how to resolve it.

With that said, if you _can't_ design a flow without a disabled state, this is
how you disable a button.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" disabled />
</Canvas>

#### Use of icons

You can use icons inside the buttons. They can stand-alone, or appear before,
after, or on top of the button label. They can also be added before or after the
label.

**Note:** If an icon is used in a stand-alone method, an `ariaLabel` must be
present to describe the button.

<Canvas>
  <Button type="secondary" icon="user" ariaLabel="I'm a person" />
  <Button label="More" type="secondary" icon="more" />
  <Button
    label="Actions"
    type="secondary"
    icon="arrowDown"
    iconOnRight={true}
  />
</Canvas>

#### Loading states

Use a loading state on a button when clicking it triggers a 
background action that takes more than a moment to complete. 
This helps SPs understand that something is happening, prevents 
them from clicking again, and avoids duplicated actions.

Only show the loading state **after** the button is clicked, 
not pre-emptively or passively.

<Canvas>
  <Button
    label="Deleting..."
    type="primary"
    variation="destructive"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button
    label="Loading..."
    type="tertiary"
    variation="learning"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button label="Canceling..." variation="subtle" loading={true} />
</Canvas>

## Variants

### Work

Work buttons help SPs move through their workflows with 
clarity and confidence. They can start or finish a task, go 
back, cancel, or confirm—depending on where the SP is and what 
they need to do next.

All work buttons should feel purposeful, with labels that 
clearly communicate outcomes.

Work buttons come in three visual variants:  
**primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary**.

#### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" />
</Canvas>

| ✅ Do                                | ❌ Don’t                             |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Use for high-value, forward actions  | Use to answer a question             |
| Use a clear, verb-first label        | Use conversational labels like “Yes” |
| Keep the label short and specific    | Use ellipses (e.g. “Save and...”)    |
| Use one primary per view             | Stack multiple primary buttons       |

**Please note:** At Jobber, we want to avoid use of elipsis in buttons. Going forward, buttons with 
grouped actions should be handled by Splitbutton.

#### Secondary

Use a secondary button when there are one or more alternate 
actions available that are less important than the primary one. 
Secondary buttons support the main task—they don’t compete with it.

They’re used for actions like going back, or 
previewing before sending.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" type="secondary" />
</Canvas>

| ✅ Do                                 | ❌ Don’t                            |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Use for optional or supporting steps | Use as a second primary              |
| Pair with a primary button           | Stack multiple secondaries together  |
| Keep labels short and outcome-based  | Use vague text like “Maybe Later”    |


#### Tertiary

Use a tertiary button for low-emphasis actions that happen 
within a view—like editing a section, showing more details, 
or navigating between tabs or steps.

These buttons are unobtrusive and helpful, but shouldn’t pull 
attention away from the task at hand.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" type="tertiary" />
</Canvas>

| ✅ Do                                 | ❌ Don’t                             |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Use for in-context interactions      | Use for key tasks or submissions      |
| Pair with a primary or secondary     | Use as a workaround for layout issues |
| Reserve for non-critical actions     | Make them the only path forward       |

### Learning

Use learning buttons to help SPs understand Jobber—whether that’s 
exploring a feature, discovering a workflow, or seeing how Jobber 
can support their business.

These buttons are for education. They often appear in onboarding, product tours, 
or marketing surfaces.

Learning buttons follow the same hierarchy as work buttons:  
**primary**, **secondary**, and **tertiary**, depending on emphasis.

#### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="secondary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="tertiary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

| ✅ Do                                  | ❌ Don’t                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Use in onboarding or educational UI   | Use in job, quote, or invoice flows       |
| Use when the goal is understanding    | Use when the goal is completing work      |
| Pair with clear, relevant messaging   | Drop into views without context           |

**Please note:** "Learn More" is the most common CTA for learning buttons. It should be
the default text. It's important to ensure that the accompanying content is clear enough
so that it's obvious to SPs what they'll be learning about when they interact with learning
button with a "Lean More" CTA.

### Destructive

Destructive buttons are used to remove something from Jobber. 
They should be clear, deliberate, and hard to activate by mistake.

Destructive actions come in **primary**, **secondary**, and 
**tertiary** styles depending on impact and context.


#### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
significant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action
should be contained in a [ConfirmationModal](/components/ConfirmationModal)
triggered by clicking a secondary or tertiary destructive button.

#### Secondary or Tertiary

Use a secondary or tertiary destructive button when:

- The deletion is low-stakes or easily reversible
- The button is a trigger for a **confirmation modal** that holds 
  the primary destructive action

In both cases, make sure it’s doesn’t compete with core workflow actions.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="secondary" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="tertiary" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Subtle

Use a "subtle" button when you want the visual appearance to be more _subtle._
This variation of button uses subdued color, allowing it to sit comfortably
alongside more prominent content.

Subtle buttons are visually de-emphasized and designed for low-priority or non-blocking actions. They use minimal styling 
so they sit quietly next to more prominent content—ideal for secondary navigation, opt-outs, or dismissing lightweight UI.

Think of icon actions in a navigation bar, buttons to dismiss a modal, or opting out of completing an action they have triggered.

_Note: This is still known as "Cancel" on mobile. See
[Mobile/Cancel example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-mobile--cancel)._

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary

A key distinction between subtle buttons and the other variations is that the
primary/secondary/tertiary scale is styled differently, but the conceptual
hierarchy is the same. Notably, the tertiary subtle button has a transparent
background, allowing it to be _extra_ subtle when placed overtop
`surface--background` elements such as a Modal header.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Cancel" type="primary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Dismiss" type="secondary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Maybe Later" type="tertiary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
    </Content>
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--background)",
        padding: "var(--space-base)",
      }}
    >
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="search"
        aria-label="search"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="cog"
        aria-label="settings"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="help"
        aria-label="help"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="more"
        aria-label="more"
      />
    </div>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

Effective button labels are clear, concise, and action-driven. 
They help SPs feel confident about what will happen next. 
These guidelines are focused on text inside buttons, not hover 
labels or tooltip content.


#### Mental model: What will happen when I click this

Use **verb-first phrasing** to emphasize action and reduce 
hesitation.

Button text should reflect the outcome of the action. Not 
necessarily the system's implementation. 

Remember that SPs are often working quickly; on mobile, between visits, or 
in the field. That means buttons should support fast, confident 
decision-making.

| ✅ Do            | ❌ Don’t               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Send Invoice     | Continue to Send       |
| Save Job         | Click Here             |
| Mark as Done     | Done                   |


#### Reflect the outcome

It's a good idea to focus on the outcome of the action with buttons, 
rather than exposing technical complexity (unless it's particularly
meaningful to SPs).

| ✅ Do               | ❌ Don’t            |
| ------------------  | -------------------  |
| Download Report     | Export to CSV       |
| Send Quote          | Generate PDF        |
| Schedule Visit      | Create Visit in Schedule  |


SPs think in terms of **visits, quotes, jobs, and invoices**. Not 
CSV files or data exports. At Jobber, we prefer terminology grounded in the 
workflow of running a service business.


#### Keep it concise

- Aim for **2–3 words**
- Don’t abbreviate unless the meaning is universally known
- Avoid truncation, ellipses, or filler words like “Please” or “Now”

| ✅ Do       | ❌ Don’t           |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Add Client | Add a New Client    |
| Delete     | Delete Permanently  |
| Sign Up    | Sign Up Now |

Try to default to being concise. It helps reduce visual noise, especially on mobile.
Key for SPs using Jobber on the go.


#### Use title case

Capitalize all major words in button labels. Don't capitalize:

- Articles: *a, an, the*
- Coordinating conjunctions: *and, but, or*
- Short prepositions: *to, by, at*

| ✅ Do        | ❌ Don’t   |
| ------------| ------------|
| Go to Visits| Go To Visits|
| Save Job    | SAVE JOB    |

Title case supports scannability and will help us maintain visual consistency across 
SP workflows.


#### Avoid ampersands

Avoid using ampersands in buttons. They’re often introduced to 
save space, but they create inconsistency and visual clutter. Put simply, 
they draw attention to the most irrelevant part of the sentence.

Use “and” unless there’s a strong reason not to—and even then, 
consider simplifying the label instead.

| ✅ Do               | ❌ Don’t        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Review and Send     | Review & Send          |
| Approve and Schedule| Approve & Schedule     |


#### Be specific

Generic CTAs like “Submit” or “Continue” generally don’t give SPs confidence.
That said, they are fine if there's another visual indicator of what comes next
E.g. a stepper.

When there's no other indication of what is coming next, try to be 
explicit about what the button does or what's to come.

| ✅ Do             | ❌ Don’t   |
| ---------------- | ------------|
| Book Appointment | Submit      |
| Send Quote       | Continue    |


#### Buttons in confirmation modals

In confirmation modals, button labels should reinforce the 
decision the SP is making—not just echo the UI element that 
triggered it.

**Primary action buttons should restate the consequence of the 
action.** This helps avoid second-guessing and reduces 
accidental taps.

| ✅ Do              | ❌ Don’t         |
| ----------------- | ------------------|
| Delete Visit       | Yes, Delete       |
| Delete Timesheet   | Confirm           |
| Send Invoice       | Submit            |
| Remove Line Item   | OK                |

**Secondary buttons** should be 
clear but low-friction. Stick with **Go Back**, unless you need 
to clarify the context.

We want to avoid questions as titles in confirmation modals, as this can
add to visual clutter and increase the cognitive load. As a result,
the button should reflect that. No answering a question, just
confirming the action.


## Do's and Don'ts

In summary, here are some general rules to follow when working with the button component:

#### Do:


- ✅ Use clear, verb-first labels that describe the outcome  
- ✅ Keep button text short (1–3 words max)  
- ✅ Use title case for button labels  
- ✅ Show a loading state for async actions  
- ✅ Use one primary button per view  
- ✅ Use hierarchy (primary, secondary, tertiary) to guide attention  
- ✅ Use destructive styling only for real deletions  
- ✅ Place buttons near the content or object they act on  
- ✅ Pair “Learn More” learning buttons with clear supporting content  
- ✅ Ensure icon-only buttons have accessible labels  

#### Don't:

- ❌ Use vague or conversational labels like “Yes” or “Okay”     
- ❌ Stack multiple primary buttons together  
- ❌ Style non-destructive actions (like “Archive”) as destructive  
- ❌ Position buttons too far away from the related content
- ❌ Rely on the button label alone to explain what it does  
- ❌ Assume icons are self-explanatory without text or `aria-label`  


## Accessibility notes


- Avoid using disabled buttons when possible—they increase 
  complexity and make it harder for SPs to understand what 
  to do next

- If a button uses only an icon, include an `aria-label` 
  so screen readers can describe the action

- Show clear feedback when a button is tapped or clicked.
 Use a loading state where applicable to prevent repeated taps
