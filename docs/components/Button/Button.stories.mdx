# Button

Buttons are a core user interface component, as they allow users to initiate,
complete, and reverse actions.

## Design & usage guidelines

The right button to use depends on:

- the type of action your user is attempting to complete
- the hierarchy of the interface the button lives in

### Work buttons

Use "work" buttons to enable user interactions with the goal of completing work
in Jobber.

#### Primary

The most important action in a view. Examples include the Save Job button, Log
In, or the main action in a dialog. There should be one Primary action per view,
at most.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" />
</Canvas>

#### Secondary

A secondary button should be used when:

- there is one or more alternative, but less important, actions to the primary
  action

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" type="secondary" />
</Canvas>

#### Tertiary

A tertiary button should be used to complete actions within the view such as
editing, revealing details, or navigating within the view.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" type="tertiary" />
</Canvas>

### Learning

Use "learning" buttons to enable user interactions in the goal of learning about
Jobber, whether for marketing or coaching purposes.

#### Primary, Secondary, Tertiary

The usage pattern for Learning Actions should follow the same logic as Work
Actions for all three levels.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="secondary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button
        label="Learn More"
        variation="learning"
        type="tertiary"
        url="//getjobber.com"
        external={true}
      />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Destructive

"Destructive" actions remove something from Jobber.

#### Primary

A Primary destructive action will permanently destroy an object carrying
significant data, such as a job, quote, or client. This destructive action
should be contained in a
[ConfirmationModal](../?path=/docs/components-overlays-confirmationmodal--docs)
triggered by clicking a secondary or tertiary destructive button.

#### Secondary or Tertiary

A Secondary or tertiary destructive action will either:

- destroy an item on an object that can be quickly restored, such as a line item
  on a job
- trigger a dialog to confirm a Primary destructive action

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="secondary" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Delete" variation="destructive" type="tertiary" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

### Subtle

Use a "subtle" button when you want the visual appearance to be more _subtle._
This variation of button uses subdued color, allowing it to sit comfortably
alongside more prominent content.

Think of icon actions in a navigation bar, buttons to dismiss a modal, or opting
out of completing an action they have triggered.

_Note: This is still known as "Cancel" on mobile. See
[Mobile/Cancel example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-mobile--cancel)._

#### Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary

A key distinction between subtle buttons and the other variations is that the
primary/secondary/tertiary scale is styled differently, but the conceptual
hierarchy is the same. Notably, the tertiary subtle button has a transparent
background, allowing it to be _extra_ subtle when placed overtop
`surface--background` elements such as a Modal header.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Cancel" type="primary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Dismiss" type="secondary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
      <Content>
        <Button label="Maybe Later" type="tertiary" variation="subtle" />
      </Content>
    </Content>
    <div
      style={{
        backgroundColor: "var(--color-surface--background)",
        padding: "var(--space-base)",
      }}
    >
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="search"
        aria-label="search"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="cog"
        aria-label="settings"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="help"
        aria-label="help"
      />
      <Button
        variation="subtle"
        type="tertiary"
        icon="more"
        aria-label="more"
      />
    </div>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Content guidelines

Button labels should be title-cased. This means in general, capitalize all words
with the exception of:

- articles (a, an, the)
- coordinating conjunctions (but, for)
- prepositions (at, by, to, etc.)

| ✅ Do        | ❌ Don't     |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Go to Visits | Go To Visits |
| Save Job     | SAVE JOB     |

### & vs and

If you have a Button with "compound" actions such as "Review & Send" or "Approve
& Schedule", use an ampersand (&) for brevity and to reduce the likelihood that
your label will wrap. A non-breaking space should be used between the ampersand
and the second word so that the ampersand wraps with the second word.

| ✅ Do              | ❌ Don't             |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Review & Send      | Review and Send      |
| Approve & Schedule | Approve and Schedule |

## Disabled

As a best practice, do not design with disabled button states. This has negative
impacts on accessibility as well as an increase in complexity for users to
understand why the interface is disabled and how to resolve it.

With that said, if you _can't_ design a flow without a disabled state, this is
how you disable a button.

<Canvas>
  <Button label="Do the Thing" disabled />
</Canvas>

## Sizes

Buttons come in three sizes. `Base` is the default and should be used for almost
every use case.

Only use `large` for extremely spacious interfaces such as a login form, and
`small` when the interface has extremely tight size constraints.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Small" size="small" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Base" />
    </Content>
    <Content>
      <Button label="Large" size="large" />
    </Content>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

## Icons

You can use icons inside the buttons. They can stand-alone, or appear before,
after, or on top of the button label. They can also be added before or after the
label.

**Note:** If an icon is used in a stand-alone method, an `ariaLabel` must be
present to describe the button.

<Canvas>
  <Button type="secondary" icon="user" ariaLabel="I'm a person" />
  <Button label="More" type="secondary" icon="more" />
  <Button
    label="Actions"
    type="secondary"
    icon="arrowDown"
    iconOnRight={true}
  />
</Canvas>

## Loading

A way to communicate to the user that a background action is being performed.

<Canvas>
  <Button
    label="Deleting..."
    type="primary"
    variation="destructive"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button
    label="Loading..."
    type="tertiary"
    variation="learning"
    loading={true}
  />
  <Button label="Canceling..." variation="subtle" loading={true} />
</Canvas>

### DEPRECATED: Client-side routing (Web only)

A Button can be used for client-side routing as well. When using a Button to
handle the client-side routing, use the `to` prop. Notice when you click below
that the URL will change to the appropriate route. See
[Web/Client Side Routing example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-web--client-side-routing).

### Client-side routing (Web only)

A Button can be used for client-side routing as well. When using a Button to
handle the client-side routing, use the `ButtonNavigationProvider`. You will
need to do the following: Wrap your application in the
`ButtonNavigationProvider` and pass the `openLink` and `buildLocationHref` props
to the provider.

`openLink` is the function that will be called when the should do a client side
navigation. It will be provided the `url`, `routerOptions` passed to the
`Button` component, and the `event` that triggered the navigation.

`buildLocationHref` is a function that will be called to build the href for the
`Button` component. It will be provided to the html anchor tag. It will recieve
the `url` and `routerOptions` passed to the `Button` component.

To provide typescript support for the `ButtonNavigationProvider` you will need
to declare the `NavigationConfig` interface in your project.

#### react-router-dom version 5 example:

```tsx
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

// Both Push and replace have the same parameters
type RouterActionParameters = Parameters<
  ReturnType<typeof useHistory>["push"]
>[1];

interface RouterOptions {
  action?: "push" | "replace";
  parameters?: RouterActionParameters;
}

declare module "@jobber/components" {
  interface NavigationConfig {
    routerOptions: RouterOptions;
    href: LocationDescriptor<unknown>;
  }
}

function AppProvider({ children }) {
  const history = useHistory();
  return (
    <ButtonNavigationProvider
      openLink={(href?: NavigationPath, routerOptions?: NavigateOptions, event) => {
        // Default to the push action
        const action = routerOptions?.action || "push";
        const historyAction =
          action === "replace" ? history.replace : history.push;
        const state = routerOptions?.parameters;
        historyAction(newPath, state);
      }}
      buildLocationHref={to => {
        if (typeof to === "string" || !to) {
          return to || "";
        } else {
          return history.createHref(to);
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ButtonNavigationProvider>
  );
}

function InnerComponent() {
  return (
    <Button
      url={{
          pathname: generatePath(MY_CUSTOM_PATH, {
            MY_PATH_PARAM: "some-param",
          }),
          search: "?my-query-param=some-query-param",
        }}
        routerOptions={{ action: "replace", { myHistoryStateValue: true}}}>
      Go to some path
    </Button>
  );
}
```

#### Tanstack router example:

```tsx
import type { NavigateOptions, ToOptions } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

declare module "@jobber/components" {
  interface NavigationConfig {
    href: ToOptions["to"];
    routerOptions: NavigateOptions;
  }
}

function AppProvider({ children }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <ButtonNavigationProvider
      buildLocationHref={(href: NavigationPath) => href?.toString() || ""}
      openLink={(href?: NavigationPath, routerOptions?: NavigateOptions) => {
        router.navigate({ to: href, ...routerOptions });
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ButtonNavigationProvider>
  );
}

function InnerComponent() {
  return (
    <Button
      to="/some-path/$someParam"
      routerOptions={{
        resetScroll: true,
        params: { someParam: "someValue" },
        search: { mySearch: "mySearchValue" },
        state: { myState: "myStateValue" },
        replace: true,
      }}
    >
      Go to some path
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Form submit (Web only)

Passing the `submit` prop will allow a Button to submit a
[Form](../?path=/docs/components-forms-and-inputs-form--docs). Since submitting
a form is a specific action, only `variation="work"` and `type="primary"` are
allowed. See
[Web/Form Submit example](../?path=/story/components-actions-button-web--form-submit)

Since this type of `Button` will only be used to submit a form, it does not make
sense to allow the `external`, `onClick`, `to`, or `url` props.
