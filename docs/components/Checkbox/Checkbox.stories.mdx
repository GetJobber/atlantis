# Checkbox

A checkbox lets a user select one or more items from a set of options.

## Design & usage guidelines

A checkbox is a familiar pattern for users who need to choose from a set of
options, or opt in to a single choice. It allows a user to provide boolean
input. It can also be in an indeterminate state when we don't know if the
checkbox is considered checked or not.

A single checkbox, a [Switch](/components/Switch), and a pair of
[radio buttons](/components/RadioGroup) can seem similar in theory, as all can
represent an either/or decision for the user. Use a switch when the user must
make a decision to turn something on or off, and a single checkbox when a user
is opting in to a choice. A pair of radio buttons can be used to help the user
decide between two discrete options, such as “fixed price” and “per visit”
invoicing options.

Of note: when a single selection is to be made, a Switch should be used rather
than a single Checkbox. Use a Checkbox only when there are multiple selection
options to choose from. when the volume of Radio options is greater than 5 (or
there are otherwise critical vertical space constraints) use Select. when the
labels on a set of Radio options are consistently small (1–2 words), use Chip.

- To let people turn a setting on or off instantly, use a
  [Switch](/components/Switch).
- To present a set of options where people can only make a single choice, use a
  [RadioGroup](/components/RadioGroup).
