# A Charter of Bits and Pieces

## Create a Comfortable Environment to Learn

> You Can Sit With Us

Everyone can be a Friend of Frends. We should create a comfortable environment
where everyone can learn and help each other out.

## Welcome Input & Contributions

> Make Fetch Happen

We will welcome input, contributions and anything that can add to our
initiatives. Adding to our infrastructure should be easy. _Frends_ should listen
to their _friends_ but are ultimately deciders.

## Be Predictable

> On Wednesdays, we wear pink

Whenever possible be predictable and common. Avoid terms of art.

- **Don’t surprise an expert:** anyone already familiar with the term will be
  surprised and probably angered if we appear to have invented a new meaning for
  it.
- **Don’t confuse a beginner:** anyone trying to learn the term is likely to do
  a web search and find its traditional meaning.

## Be Simple

> Whatever, I’m getting cheese fries

When in doubt do the simplest / easiest / obvious thing. Do things where there
is a need for them.

## Good Encapsulation

> She doesn't even go here

Know where the walls are. Components should have a strict and deliberate API.
Options should be provided with intention. **Consumers are more important than
implementation.**
