# Frontend Styleguide

## Purpose

Our goal with Typescript and React code is to automate as much style guidance as
we can. To that end this guide serves to document conventions that we can't (or
haven't yet been able to) automate. Automation is always preferred to adding a
guidance here.

## Property naming conventions

Consider common terminology across components and design foundations when naming
properties. As Atlantis is a system, end users should expect similar-behaving
properties to have similar names across the system. For example...

### Base vs "Default" or "Medium" for setting the default option in a range

We use `base` as our default whenever possible when a property has a set range
of outcomes. This can be seen in..

- the `size` properties of [Button](/components/Button),
  [Avatar](/components/Avatar), [InputText](/components/InputText),
  [Text](/components/Text), [ProgressBar](/components/ProgressBar),
  [Spinner](/components/Spinner), etc;
- `maxLines` of [Text](/components/Text)
- values of [Shadow](/design/elevationss), [Spacing](/design/spacing),
  [Border Radius](/design/borders) design tokens

This allows us to set an expectation of the base (or most common) use case when
a prop is in action.

### Open and closed states

If a component has `open` and `closed` states, use a boolean property named
`open`.

This can be seen in [Modal](/components/Modal), [Drawer](/components/Drawer),
and [Popover](/components/Popover).

## Typescript

### Linter Exceptions

While we should strive to conform to our set linter rules, if for some reason
you are unable to you should turn them off for the single line where the
exception is required.

You should also leave a comment immediately above the exception explaining why
it is necessary.

#### ✅ Do

```ts
// Pending: https://github.com/donavon/use-event-listener/pull/12
// The types in useEventListener mistakenly require a SyntheticEvent for the passed generic.
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment
//@ts-ignore
useEventListener<KeyboardEvent>("keydown", (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
```

```ts
// Library requires fetching its CSS.
// eslint-disable-next-line import/no-internal-modules
import "react-image-lightbox/style.css";
```

#### ❌ Don't

Missing rationale for disabling rule.

```ts
// eslint-disable-next-line max-statements
function MyBigComponent() {
```

```ts
const { given, expect: expectation, serverRates } = assertion;
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/valid-describe
describe(`given ${given}`, () => {
```

Missing rationale and disabling rules for a whole file.

```ts
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/camelcase */
/* eslint-disable max-statements */
import React, { ReactText, useState } from "react";
```

### Use XOR over Unions for conditional properties

When creating props that will change from required to optional, we prefer to use
[XOR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-xor) over
[Unions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html).
This allows us to be more secure with our `interface` by saying a type will
either be `TypeA` or `TypeB` but never a combination of both.

```tsx
import { XOR } from "ts-xor";

interface BaseComponentProps {
  readonly label?: string;
  readonly icon?: IconNames;
}

interface ComponentWithActionProps extends BaseComponentProps {
  readonly icon: IconNames;
  onClick?(): void;
}

type ComponentProps = XOR<BaseComponentProps, ComponentWithActionProps>;
```

In the example above, our `BaseComponentProps` tells us that the `label` and the
`icon` are both optional properties. In `ComponentWithActionProps` we tell
typscript that we are extending the `BaseComponentProps`, but the `icon` is now
a required property, and we have added an additional `onClick` property. The
result will look something like:

```tsx
✅
<Component label="Atlantis" icon="gift" />
✅
<Component label="Atlantis" icon="gift" onClick={() => alert('Hello 👋')} />
✅
<Component icon="gift" onClick={() => alert('Hello 👋')} />
❌
<Component label="Atlantis" onClick={() => alert('Hello 👋')} />
```

The last example will cause a typescript error because we have now said that if
an `onClick` is used, then the component must be using the
`ComponentWithActionProps`. Since that is the case, the `icon` property is now
required.

### `function` vs arrow function

In an effort to make our Typescript code a bit more accessible we are preferring
the `function` keyword to define named functions.

#### ✅ Do

```ts
function MyComponent() {
  // ...
}
```

```ts
[1, 2, 3].map(num => num * 2);
```

#### ❌ Don't

```ts
const MyComponent = () => {
  // ...
};
```

### Interface Declaration

#### ✅ Do

```ts
interface MyInterface {
  foo: number;
  bar: string;
}
```

#### ❌ Don't

```ts
type MyInterface = {
  foo: number;
  bar: string;
};
```

## CSS

Wherever possible use Atlantis `design` tokens.

### Spacing (margins and padding)

Use the appropriate [Spacing](/design/spacing) values for spacing. Do not use
rems, ems, or hard-coded pixel values.

If you require a space that is larger than the Spacing values, or falls
somewhere in between, use the CSS `calc` function with Atlantis spacing values
in a custom property in your file.

#### ✅ Do

```css
.myComponent {
  padding: var(--space-small) var(--space-base);
}

.myComponent.large {
  padding: calc(var(--space-small) + var(--space-smaller)) var(--space-large);
}
```

#### ❌ Don't

```css
.myComponent {
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.myComponent.large {
  padding: 0.75rem 2rem;
}
```

### Size (width and height)

In most cases, the size (width and height) of an individual component is
implicitly determined by the content and spacing. However, sometimes you'll
reasonably need to explicitly define rules like "this component should be a
minimum of 280px wide".

Do not use spacing tokens to define size - just provide the specific value. To
reduce the "magic" of the number, you can declare this value in a CSS custom
property to re-use and manipulate throughout the component.

#### ✅ Do

```css
.drawerContainer {
  --drawer-width: 280px;
}

.drawer {
  width: var(--drawer-width);
}

.drawer.large {
  --drawer-width: 400px;
}
```

#### ❌ Don't

```css
.drawerContainer {
  --drawer-width: calc(var(--space-base) * 17.5);
}

.drawer {
  width: var(--drawer-width);
}

.drawer.large {
  --drawer-width: calc(var(--space-base) * 25);
}
```

### Targeting native HTML selectors

Use a classname to select DOM elements for styling whenever possible.

Scope CSS selectors that target native HTML elements with a classname if you
cannot add a classname to the element directly. This keeps the styling
encapsulated to the component and prevents styling from "leaking out" of the
React component and into the rest of the project.

#### ✅ Do

```css
a.myDestructiveComponent {
  color: var(--color-destructive);
}

// this will only select `<a>` elements with the `myDestructiveComponent` classname
```

#### ❌ Don't

```css
a {
  color: var(--color-destructive);
}

// this will select every `<a>` element in the project
```

### Component-level variables

CSS custom properties can be used to define component-level variables. This
allows you to define a value once and use it throughout the component. Consider
the scope of these variables when you create and use one in your component.

#### Private variables (most common)

In most cases, you will want to define component variables on the parent of the
component's DOM structure to prevent accidental styling leaks.

```css
.myComponent {
  --myComponent--width: 72px;
}
```

#### Public variables (⚠️ use with caution)

If other Atlantis components, or consumers of Atlantis, shoud need to manipulate
a value, then it should be set on `:root` and prefixed with `--public--`. These
should represent relatively rare use cases, and should be used sparingly.

```css
.root {
  --public--myComponent--width: 72px;
}

.myComponent {
  width: var(--public--myComponent--width);
}

// this will allow anyone in a project consuming Atlantis to modify the width of the component
// without needing to modify the component itself
```
