# Create your own component

<Text variation="intro">
  So, you want to create a react component in atlantis but, you don't know where
  to start. This guide would help you understand the basic concepts around
  building a component in Atlantis.
</Text>

## Before we start

Few things you need to know about Atlantis. We use [React](https://reactjs.org/)
to build components and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to help
control the chaos because javascript code can get really messy. There are more
reasons around why we use typescript but that's not the point of this guide.
We're here to make components! YAY!!ðŸŽ‰

_"Wait hold up! Typescript?! That POS, strictly typed, PITA that gives vague
explanation as to why..."_

Hold your horses there, cowboy. Give it a chance and treat it more as a guide
than an enemy you need to please in order to move forward.

Oh, and this also assumes that you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. I'll do my best to explain some concepts around as we go along but,
you should be able to follow along.

## What are we building?

In this guide, we'll show you how to build a counter component.

Easy peasy, right?

## Let's get started

### Prerequisites

1. [Install and run Atlantis](/#development) because you need it to create a
   component in atlantis.
2. Autogenerate a new component called `AmountCounter` by running `npm run plop`
   on a new terminal.

> Protip: React components are named in `PascalCase`
