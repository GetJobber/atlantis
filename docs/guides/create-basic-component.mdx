# Create your own component

So, you want to create a react component in atlantis but, you don't know where
to start. This guide would help you understand the basic concepts around
building a component in Atlantis.

## Before we start

Few things you need to know about Atlantis. We use [React](https://reactjs.org/)
to build components and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to help
control the chaos because javascript code can get really messy. There are more
reasons around why we use typescript but that's not the point of this guide.
We're here to make components! YAY!!ðŸŽ‰

_"Wait hold up! Typescript?! That POS, strictly typed, PITA that gives vague
explanation as to why..."_

Hold your horses there, cowboy. Give it a chance and treat it more as a guide
than an enemy you need to please in order to move forward.

Oh, and this also assumes that you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. I'll do my best to explain some concepts around as we go along but,
you should be able to follow along.

## What are we building?

In this guide, we'll show you how to build a counter component.

Easy peasy, right?

## Prerequisites

1. [Install and run Atlantis](/#development) because you need it to create a
   component in atlantis.
2. Setup your editor to have have the auto fixers. Life is too short to do your
   own fixing for code that can be automatically fixed.
3. Auto-generate a new component called `AmountCounter` by running
   `npm run plop` on a new terminal.

> Tip: React components are named in **`PascalCase`**

Once that's done, it should tell you where the files got added.

```sh
? Component Name: AmountCounter
âœ”  +! 5 files added
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/index.ts
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.css
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.css.d.ts
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.mdx
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.test.tsx
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.tsx
```

### What are thooooose?!

Right, I promised to explain them.

| File name                | Description                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `index.ts`               | This tells react what to render. Honestly, You'd probably never have to touch this.                                             |
| `AmountCounter.tsx`      | This file is where you make the magic happen                                                                                    |
| `AmountCounter.mdx`      | This creates the page that you see in Atlantis. This is where you explain what the magic is doing.                              |
| `AmountCounter.test.tsx` | Self explanatory.                                                                                                               |
| `AmountCounter.css`      | Self explanatory.                                                                                                               |
| `AmountCounter.css.d.ts` | This is how react knows what class names you added and automagically serializes them so it doesn't clash with other components. |

## Let's get started

Actually, no! Let's take a step back and look at the mock up again. But this
time, it's annotated with the HTML elements and types that we think it should
have.

<img
  src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/AmountPicker-annotated.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}
/>

This makes it easier to write the code because we now have an idea on what the
HTML elements and types of props the component could take. We'll ignore the card
for now as components should be pluggable anywhere and a card would restrict the
overall re-usability of this component.

### Time to write some code

Open the `AmountCounter.tsx` because that's where we make the magic happen. That
file should already have boilerplate code on it that we could break down in to 3
categories.

### Imports

A little blurb about imports.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/imports.png" />

We'll get in to more detail about `classnames` and `styles` later.

### Interface

This is where you specify the prop types that we got from the annotations
earlier.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/props.png" />

_WHAT?! Where did those come from? What is happening? I thought this was
simple._

Let's break it down, shall we?

| Artifact                           | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/*Comment*/`                      | Explains what the prop is doing. If you use VSCode, this also show up when you hover on the prop name.                                      |
| `readonly`                         | Prevents the prop from getting re-assigned. We gotta have some rules, people!                                                               |
| `title` `value`                    | This is the prop name                                                                                                                       |
| `description?` `onChange?`         | Optional props. That tells typescript that this prop is optional. That means the componentâ€”if written properlyâ€”would still work without it. |
| `string` `number` `boolean` `void` | This is the prop type. This makes sure that you can only pass in the specified type to make the component predictable and manageable.       |

_What about the `onChange?()` prop? It looks different_

Yes, because it's a callback. They're used to tell the parent component that the
`AmountCounter` changed and it returned a new value. Now, some components need
them, some don't. Some have params, some doesn't need it. It really depends on
what kind of component are you writing. In our case, we need it.

### Component

```
export function AmountCounter({ ... }: AmountCounterProps) {
  return <div>I'm a component</div>;
}
```
