# Create your own component

So, you want to create a react component in atlantis but, you don't know where
to start. This guide would help you understand the basic concepts around
building a component in Atlantis.

## Before we start

Few things you need to know about Atlantis. We use [React](https://reactjs.org/)
to build components and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to help
control the chaos because javascript code can get really messy. There are more
reasons around why we use typescript but that's not the point of this guide.
We're here to make components! YAY!!ðŸŽ‰

_"Wait hold up! Typescript?! That POS, strictly typed, PITA that gives vague
explanation as to why..."_

Hold your horses there, cowboy. Give it a chance and treat it more as a guide
than an enemy you need to please in order to move forward.

Oh, and this also assumes that you have some familiarity with HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. I'll do my best to explain some concepts around as we go along but,
you should be able to follow along.

## What are we building?

In this guide, we'll show you how to build a counter component.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/AmountPicker.png" />

Easy peasy, right?

## Prerequisites

1. [Install and run Atlantis](/#development) because you need it to create a
   component in atlantis.
2. Setup your editor to have have the auto fixers. Life is too short to do your
   own fixing for code that can be automatically fixed.
3. Auto-generate a new component called `AmountCounter` by running
   `npm run plop` on a new terminal.

> Tip: React components are named in **`PascalCase`**

Once that's done, it should tell you where the files got added.

```sh
? Component Name: AmountCounter
âœ”  +! 5 files added
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/index.ts
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.css
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.css.d.ts
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.mdx
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.test.tsx
 -> /packages/components/src/AmountCounter/AmountCounter.tsx
```

### What are thooooose?!

Right, I promised to explain them.

| File name                | Description                                                                                                                     |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `index.ts`               | This tells react what to render. Honestly, You'd probably never have to touch this.                                             |
| `AmountCounter.tsx`      | This file is where you make the magic happen                                                                                    |
| `AmountCounter.mdx`      | This creates the page that you see in Atlantis. This is where you explain what the magic is doing.                              |
| `AmountCounter.test.tsx` | Self explanatory.                                                                                                               |
| `AmountCounter.css`      | Self explanatory.                                                                                                               |
| `AmountCounter.css.d.ts` | This is how react knows what class names you added and automagically serializes them so it doesn't clash with other components. |

## Let's get started

Actually, no! Let's take a step back and look at the mock up again. But this
time, it's annotated with the HTML elements and types that we think it should
have.

<img
  src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/AmountPicker-annotated.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}
/>

This makes it easier to write the code because we now have an idea on what the
HTML elements and types of props the component could take. We'll ignore the card
for now as components should be pluggable anywhere and a card would restrict the
overall re-usability of this component.

### Time to write some code

Open the `AmountCounter.tsx` because that's where we make the magic happen. That
file should already have boilerplate code on it that we could break down in to 3
categories.

### Imports

A little blurb about imports.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/imports.png" />

We'll get in to more detail about `classnames` and `styles` later.

### Interface

This is where you specify the prop types that we got from the annotations
earlier.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/props.png" />

_WHAT?! Where did those come from? What is happening? I thought this was
simple._

Let's break it down, shall we?

| Artifact                           | Description                                                                                                                           |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/*Comment*/`                      | Explains what the prop is doing. If you use VSCode, this also show up when you hover on the prop name.                                |
| `readonly`                         | Prevents the prop from getting re-assigned. We gotta have some rules, people!                                                         |
| `title` `value`                    | This is the prop name                                                                                                                 |
| `description?` `onChange?`         | Still a prop name but this time it's optional. That means the componentâ€”if written properlyâ€”would still work without it.              |
| `string` `number` `boolean` `void` | This is the prop type. This makes sure that you can only pass in the specified type to make the component predictable and manageable. |

_What about the `onChange?()` prop? It looks different_

Yes, because it's a callback. They're used to tell the parent component that the
`AmountCounter` changed and it returned a new value. Now, some components need
them, some don't. Some have params, some doesn't need it. It really depends on
what kind of component are you writing. In our case, we need it.

_Ok, but we specified increment and decrement on the annotations. I don't see
that here._

True, part of building a component is to make sure you only specify what you
need and improve overtime. I think the `onChange()` could encompass both
increment and decrement. I could be wrong, but let's see where this takes us.

### Component

Now that we know the base props that we need. Yes, I said _base_ because it
might need more than what we specified. First up, we need to tell the component
about the props we specified like so:

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/component-props.png" />

_Oh no, typescript is already mad at me_

First of all [insert meme here], it's a machine, it got no feelings, aight?
Second it's just telling you that you ain't using the thing yet. That's helpful
when you's writing a component super fast!

Anyhoo, let's break it down

| Artifact            | Description                                                                                                           |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `export`            | This allows us to use the component everywhere!                                                                       |
| `function`          | Self explanatory.                                                                                                     |
| `AmountCounter`     | Component name and also the function name. But, you already knew that.                                                |
| `{ ... }`           | Defines the props that you'd like to use from AmountCounterProps.                                                     |
| `AmoutCounterProps` | Reference to the props that we specified earlier. This is how the component knows the props and the types we can use. |

#### Writing the HTML structure

Let's look back at the annotated mockup again for guidance.

<img
  src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/AmountPicker-annotated.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}
/>

It seems that we need a:

- **Heading**: We can use the [Heading](/components/heading) component
- **Paragraph**: We can use the [Text](/components/text) component
- **Input**: We need an input that can only accept number. We can use the
  [InputNumber](/components/input-number) component
- **Buttons**: This one is special case so, we'll write our own CSS for it.

Not worrying about the layout for now and focusing on making the base structure
work first; you should have something like this.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/component-jsx.png" />

Few things to note here:

- Commented out the `className` const. We might need it later.
- That `<> ... </>` is called a
  [React fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). Yes, it's way
  better than an unstyled `div`.

You should also have this on your imports because it needs to know where to get
the `Heading`, `Text`, and `InputNumber` component.

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/imported-existing-components.png" />

There will be warning around the imports and that's fine. Frends is aware of it
but that shouldn't stop you from making your own component. Onwards!

#### How do I preview this?

Glad you asked, go to `AmountCounter.mdx` and drop the code below on that file.

```
<Playground>
  <AmountCounter
    title="Children"
    description="Ages 2 - 12"
    value={0}
  />
</Playground>
```

If everything is correct, you should see something like this:

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/first-preview.png" />

Not quite the same as the mockup but, you know, baby steps.

## Style me up!

Now that we have the basic structure, we can style to look like the mockup.
Let's reference the mockup again. This time, it's annotated by a simple grid
system.

<img
  src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/AmountPicker-gridified.png"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%" }}
/>

So we have a classic 2 columns grid. In order for us to do that, we have to
group our elements.

- **Black** as the wrapping element
- **Pink** as the column element
- **Orange** as the elements we currently have

Once grouped, you should have something like this:

<img src="/public/assets/images/create-react-component/component-grouped.png" />

_Oh c'mon typescript! I know it's not there because I haven't written it yet!_

If you look at it as like a halfway TDD, those red underline things are errors
that you need to get rid of by continuing to write the code! TDD Red, Green,
Refactor, amirite? Onwards!

_Quick question, what's with the `styles.wrapper` why not just type the class
name directly?_

We have to serialize those class names so it doesn't clash with other class
names. Plus, naming is hard so you can keep writing `wrapper` on all of the
wrapper components and it would still work.

### Writing the CSS
