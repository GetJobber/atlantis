# Empty states

## Goal

Ensure the user does not hit a dead end when there is no content to display.

## Use when...

Use when there _could_ be content in a view, but there is none. Possible reasons
for the “emptiness” may include, but are not limited to…

- A notifications panel when the user hasn't received any notifications
- A list of user-generated content before user has created any content (for
  example, a list of clients when the user doesn’t yet have any clients)
- Dashboards or other data-centric views when the user has not generated any
  data (ie Home)
- Search results with no match
- An error has resulted in the user not being able to access content they
  otherwise could

## Principles

- [Visibility of system status](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/)
- [Consistency and standards](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/consistency-and-standards/)
- [Aesthetics and minimalist design](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/aesthetic-and-minimalist-design/)
- [Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/#toc-9-help-users-recognize-diagnose-and-recover-from-errors-9)

## Solution

A successful empty state should

- communicate system status
- increase learnability of the system
- deliver direct pathways for key tasks

[Designing Empty States in Complex Applications: 3 Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empty-state-interface-design/#:~:text=Empty%20states%20that%20are%20intentionally,getting%20started%20with%20key%20tasks)

#### When _not_ to add a CTA

You might not use a direct CTA in the empty state if:

- The action to populate the empty state has dependencies on another action
  being taken
  - Example: Quotes must be approved by clients before they appear in a list of
    "approved quotes"
  - Example: A payment requires creation and delivery of an invoice, and the
    client to make a payment, before it exists

### Empty states in lists

When there is an empty state where a list of items would be, provide an
explanation of why the list is empty.

When relevant, provide a call-to-action.

<Figma url="https://www.figma.com/design/HXWXusJPZLmaJNGlKEpiyhXW/Product%2FBase?m=auto&node-id=21162-768&t=SHOjoSApnGE6QQeB-1" />

Where relevant, a CTA is offered to allow the user to populate the list - this
CTA also allows the user to initiate a key step in adopting the product.

No results due to no matching query vs. no results due to a lack of content are
handled differently as the action to resolve (new search) is near-at-hand in the
case of the “no matching” query.

### Error states

An example of an empty state that is used in our ErrorFallback template. An
alert icon reinforces that something’s gone wrong, the message explains what’s
happened and the action offers a clear path to try and resolve the issue.

This error state takes up the entire view, so we have space to offer:

Clear visual reinforcement via icon

Heading summarizing the issue

Descriptive text explaining resolution path

CTA to allow immediate recovery attempt

The user could also pull-to-refresh in this scenario, but the button allows for
both non-gesture-based resolution and reduces the leap from understanding to
acting.

wrong followed by a message that says Could not load content. Refresh to try
again. and a Refresh button.

Empty states in main views (such as Tabs) An example of an empty state
explaining why it’s empty, and a clear CTA to populate the section - again, this
also helps guide to the user to take a key action in adopting a valuable feature
of Jobber.

Empty states in cards and similar content containers within larger views If a
card is empty, but has a clear action to add content, there’s no need to provide
additional messaging. For example, see the “Invoices” card which has a + action
to immediately create an invoice.

When a card is empty, and there is no way for the user to add content (ex. the
user doesn’t have permission), show an empty state with a description to give
the user context. Do not hide the card, as this state-based hiding and showing
may not be intuitive for the user. For example, see the”Payments” card here,
where the user needs to create an invoice and interact with the SC before they
can create a payment against a job.

Within a card, the same rules apply. In this example from Timesheets, there is
no “empty state” for the notes on the timesheet entry because the “EDIT” action
on the card allows the user to directly add that information.

## Why

By considering and accounting for these often “un-happy” paths in the user’s
journey, we can allow the user to learn how to use Jobber more effectively,
guide them out of troublesome scenarios, and ensure that they never feel like
they’ve hit a dead-end in the product.

## Not obvious details

In some cases, illustrations may be useful in an empty state to bring some
personality to the scenario. If this fits your use case, work with the design
team to find or create an appropriate illustration.

## Implementation

<Tabs>
  <Tab label="Web">
   There's no component but these are some common patterns:

  <Canvas>
    <Box direction="column" alignItems="center" gap="base" width="100%">
      <Icon size="large" name="alert" />
      <Heading level={4}>No results found</Heading>
      <Text>Try adjusting your search criteria or clearing filters</Text>
      <Button variation="subtle" label="Clear Filters" />
    </Box>
  </Canvas>
  </Tab>
  <Tab label="Mobile">
    [EmptyState](../component/EmptyState?mobile) gives you the boilerplate 
    `Icon` + `Heading` + `Text` + `Button` out of the box but you can also compose it
    similar to the web implementation if more flexibility is needed.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
