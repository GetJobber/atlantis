## Goal

Inform the user when something is wrong, and equip them with the resources to
set it right whenever possible.

## Use when…

An error has occurred, whether due to

#### User actions

- the user has left a required form field empty
- the user has selected an invalid option
- the user has entered data in an invalid format
- the user has requested data that doesn’t exist

#### Systemic problems

- the system is unable to connect to the server
- the system took to long to process and has timed out
- the system is undergoing maintenance and cannot be used

## Solution

First and foremost: design to avoid the possibility of errors!

> Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent
> problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone
> conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option
> before they commit to the action.

With that said, it’s largely impossible to avoid _all_ of the errors, _all_ of
the time. By being proactive, we can help users recover effectively to reduce
disruption to their task-at-hand.

#### Effective content

This is the most important, so it comes first. Follow the guidance in our
[product vocabulary](../content/product-vocabulary) and
[voice & tone](../content/voice-and-tone) guides to help you craft effective
error messages.

#### Generic errors

In the case where something's gone wrong and we cannot predict or know the
cause, the alert should say **Something went wrong. Please try again later.**

<Canvas>
  <Banner type="error">
    <Text>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</Text>
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

Whenever possible, avoid showing raw error messages (`500 response timeout`) in
the app. Write like a human and whenever possible explain if there's anything
the user can do to resolve the issue.

#### Inline errors

This is probably the most common scenario. In these instances, provide a clear,
concise message as close as possible to the impacted or offending elements in
the interface.

<Canvas>
  <InputText invalid placeholder="First name" />
  <InputValidation message="First name is required" />
</Canvas>

#### System-wide errors

If an issue is not specific to a given screen or user flow, use a "global" error
message. This should be a banner that runs across the top of the app'

#### Empty states

If content is missing as a result of the error, follow guidance around
[empty states.](../patterns/empty-states)

## Implementation

### Forms and inputs

Atlantis inputs like InputText have input validation built-in for ease of use.
The input validation is integrated with the Form components on both web and
mobile as well.

You can also provide InputValidation externally if needed.

### System-wide feedback

Jobber uses a GlobalBanner system to present
