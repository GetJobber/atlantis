# Errors

| **Platform**                                                     | **Status**                                     |

## Goal

Inform the user when something is wrong, and equip them with the resources to
set it right whenever possible.

> Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent
> problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone
> conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option
> before they commit to the action.

With that said, itâ€™s largely impossible to avoid _all_ of the errors, _all_ of
the time. By being proactive, we can help users recover effectively to reduce
disruption to their task-at-hand.

## Solution

First and foremost: design to avoid the possibility of errors!

#### Effective content

Follow the guidance in our [product vocabulary](../content/product-vocabulary)
and [voice & tone](../content/voice-and-tone) guides to help you craft effective
error messages.

#### Validation and form inputs

Provide a clear, concise message as close as possible to the impacted or
offending elements.

<Canvas>
  <InputText invalid placeholder="First name" />
  <InputValidation message="First name is required" />
</Canvas>

#### System or network errors

When an error isn't tied to an inidivual UI element, place a Banner near the
impacted area. If the issue impacts the entire view, place the banner at the top
of the view.

<Canvas>
  <Content>
    <Text>Be specific about what went wrong when possible</Text>
    <Banner type="error">
      <Text>Could not connect to the server</Text>
    </Banner>
    <Banner type="error">
      <Text>The network is taking too long to respond</Text>
    </Banner>
    <Text>
      If for whatever reason, we can't provide more detail to the user, use this
      generic fallback message:
    </Text>
    <Banner type="error">
      <Text>Something went wrong. Please try again later.</Text>
    </Banner>
  </Content>
</Canvas>

Whenever possible, avoid showing raw error messages (like
`500 response timeout`) in the app. Write like a human and explain if there's
anything the user can do to resolve the issue.

#### System-wide errors

If an issue is not specific to a given screen or user flow, use a "global" error
message. This should be a banner that runs across the top of the application.

#### Empty states

If content is missing as a result of the error, follow guidance around
[empty states.](../patterns/empty-states)

## Implementation

### Forms and inputs

Atlantis inputs like [InputText](../components/InputText) have input validation
built-in for ease of use. The input validation is integrated with the
[Form](../components/Form) components on both web and mobile as well.

You can also provide [InputValidation](../components/InputValidation) externally
if needed.

### System-wide feedback

Jobber has an internal system called "GlobalBanner" that consolidates all
system-wide messages for presentation on web and mobile. If something critical
is occurring related to the user's account, it should be displayed in this
banner.
