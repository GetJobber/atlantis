## Concepts and Items

In general, none of these should be capitalized unless explicitly stated or when
used in a page title.

<br />

### address / property / service address / billing address

Use **property** when referring to the service address, custom fields and tax
rate altogether.

On quotes and invoices, use **service address** instead of property address to
clearly differentiate between a **billing address**.

<br />

### app / application / integration

Use app when referring to the Jobber app itself, or the apps provided within the
App Marketplace. Apps in the Marketplace can also just be referred to by their
brand name.

### client hub

Always refer to our service consumer portal as the customer's client hub. Stick
to sentence case, as it is a general term, not branded.

| **✅ Do **                                 | **❌ Don't**                               |

| Learn how disputes work and how to prevent them in our [Help Center](#concepts-and-items) | Learn how disputes work and how to prevent them in our [Documentation](#concepts-and-items) |

Stick to descriptive labels that give more context of where the link is taking a
user.

| **✅ Do **                                                                                | **❌ Don't**                                                                              |

## General Phrasing

### please

Avoid **please** for the most part, particularly in error messages to avoid
overuse and loss of meaning.

| Your card cannot be used to make this payment, please contact your card issuer | Your card cannot be used to make this payment\. Contact your card issuer\. |

| Client cannot have more than 1500 email addresses | Sorry, can not add email address. You may not have more than 1500 email addresses on a single client. |

### valid / invalid

Avoid defaulting to generic messages for invalid fields where possible, as they
can be unhelpful.

| **✅ Do**                      | **❌ Don't**               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Email address must contain a @ | Enter a valid phone number |

Sometimes we can't account for all states of an error though, in this case err
on using "valid".

| **✅ Do**                     | **❌ Don't**                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Enter a valid expiration year | The expiration year is invalid, please try again |
