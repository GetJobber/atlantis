Use **please** sparingly when we're requesting the user to take additional
effort to resolve an issue, outside of standard errors.

| **✅ Do**                                                                      | **❌ Don't**                                                               |

### sorry

Avoid using **sorry** much like the word please, as they can lose meaning when
overused.

| **✅ Do**                                         | **❌ Don't**                                                                                          |

| Client cannot have more than 1500 email addresses | Sorry, can not add email address. You may not have more than 1500 email addresses on a single client. |

### success, successful, successfully

Avoid these words in general as they are redundant.

| **✅ Do**               | **❌ Don't**                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Your password was reset | Successfully reset your password |

If referring to the **Success** team, always capitalize Success.

| **✅ Do**                                            | **❌ Don't**                                         |

### valid / invalid

Avoid defaulting to generic messages for invalid fields where possible, as they
can be unhelpful.

| **✅ Do**                      | **❌ Don't**               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Email address must contain a @ | Enter a valid phone number |

Sometimes we can't account for all states of an error though, in this case err
on using "valid".

| **✅ Do**                     | **❌ Don't**                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Enter a valid expiration year | The expiration year is invalid, please try again |
