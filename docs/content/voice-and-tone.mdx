# Voice and tone

## Active voice

Lead with the verb in UX copy so that the user understands the action they need
to take, rather than leading with the item they must take action on.

| ✅ **Do **                                         | ❌ **Don't**                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Turn on **show pricing** to give access to reports | **Show pricing** must be turned on in order to view reports |

The user is the implied subject in UX copy so there is no need to include an
explicit subject such as "You must... ".
