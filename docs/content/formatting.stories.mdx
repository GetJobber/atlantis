# Formatting

## Capitalization

Use sentence-case for almost all typographic content, with the exception of
instances where all-caps is a stylistic decision (i.e. MON WED TUE as calendar
weekday headers).

This means in general, capitalize only the first letter of the content unless
there is a proper noun (such as a person's name) involved. This applies to
headings and titles, as well as card headers and menu options.

Jobber features such as jobs, quotes, and invoices are not proper nouns and
should not be capitalized.

### Names

Respect user input for names and do not force capitalization. For example, names
like “LaGrange”, “DeAndre”, and “dos Santos” all carry meaning, and we should
not impose a standardized structure that omits these nuances.

### Buttons

Button labels should be title-cased. This means in general, capitalize all words
with the exception of:

- articles (a, an, the)
- coordinating conjunctions (but, for)
- prepositions (at, by, to, etc.)

## Punctuation

### Periods

Don't use a period in microcopy such as error messages, list items, or form
instructions.

| ✅ **Do**        | ❌ **Don't**      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Enter your email | Enter your email. |

### Ampersands

Use an ampersand (&) for titles and in labels of “compound” actions to keep
things short and snappy.

| ✅ **Do**          | ❌ **Don't**         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Review & Send      | Review and Send      |
| Approve & Schedule | Approve and Schedule |

### Multiplication

Use the `×` symbol to indicate multiplication whenever possible, rather than an
`x`.

| **✅ Do**   | **❌ Don't** |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 12 × $48.00 | 12 x $48.00  |

<br />

---

## Date and time

Where applicable, respect the time and date formats as set in the account's
settings.

### 12-hour time

12-hour time format should use uppercase letters and no puncutation.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 2:00 PM   | 2 p.m.       |

<br />

### 24-hour time

24-hour time format should not include any additional verbiage.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |

<br />

### Date and time

Separate date and time by a comma and avoid any additional punctuation.

### Time duration

Display hours, minutes and seconds when a timer is actively running.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 0:04:31   | 0:04         |

Display hours and minutes rounded up and in simplified words when referring to a
record of time.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1h 21min  | 1:21:21      |

<br />

Always use the shortened month unit. When space is limited, remove the year.

| ✅ **Do**   | ❌ **Don't**     |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| Dec 5, 2022 | December 5, 2022 |

<br />

### Ranges

Date and time ranges should be separated by an en-dash, not a hyphen.

| ✅ **Do**               | ❌ **Don't**  |
| ----------------------- | ------------- |
| 2:00 PM &#8211; 4:00 PM | 2:00PM-4:00PM |

<br />

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't** |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Jan 2, 2022 &#8211; Jan 4, 2022 | Jan 2-Jan 4  |

When a date range overlaps a year, make sure the year is indicated.

| ✅ **Do**                                        | ❌ **Don't**                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Dec 31 2022, 2:00 PM &#8211; Jan 1 2023, 3:00 PM | Dec 31, 2:00 PM &#8211; Jan 1, 3:00 PM |

<br />

### Numerical abbreviation

Minimize the use of decimal places in numbers unless essential. Begin abbreviating numbers at ten thousand when precision is not crucial.

| ✅ **Do**     | ❌ **Don't**     |
| ------------- | --------------  |
| $3,345        | $3,345.34       |
| $32k          | $32,462         |
