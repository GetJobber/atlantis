# Voice & tone

To keep our messages aligned and consistent, we have some guidelines for the
voice and tone of our language. Our **voice** is like our personality and it
stays constant. Our **tone** can vary to fit a context or mood. Both of them
should affect what we say and how we say it.

More than anything else, language in Jobber products should be functional. This
means clarity comes first. When writing for product, our goal is to make our
users’ lives simpler and more productive by guiding them to what they want to do
as quickly and smoothly as possible. Try to give them the information they need
in that moment—no more and no less.

Our full
[Voice & Tone guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/136CPyjDordlEGLgo1UBPRNy-rw2MMvyh35eCdRK8fJM/edit?usp=sharing)
are available for internal use. This guide breaks down some of the
product-focused principles with specific examples of what to do (and what not to
do).

## Guidelines

### Don't be technical

Don’t use words that would mean nothing to a stranger on the street. We’re here
to make our users’ lives simpler and less stressful, not to teach them about
computer science.

| ✅ **Do**                     | ❌ **Don't**                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| No search results for "Brian" | Could not detect match for string "Brian" |

### Error messages should be helpful

#### Explain

Explain what happened, and how to address the issue in a concise manner. If you
can't be specific, be general without being overly technical.

Avoid blaming the user in form validations - focus on the fix.

Empathize with the user - this probably isn't a great time for jokes.

| ✅ **Do**                                                          | ❌ **Don't**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 555-555-5555 is already on file for this client                      | Duplicate value detected                      |
| Something went wrong. [Return to Home](/)                          | Error 140024 (Unauthorized)                   |
| Password must be at least 12 characters                            | Invalid: minimum string length 12             |
| Jobber is currently unavailable. Contact support at 1-888-721-1115 | Whoopsie! The servers are taking a little nap |

### Active voice

Lead with the action so that the user understands the action they need to take,
rather than leading with the item they must take action on.

| ✅ **Do**                                          | ❌ **Don't**                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Turn on **show pricing** to give access to reports | **Show pricing** must be turned on in order to view reports |

The user is the implied subject in most scenarios so there is no need to include
an explicit subject such as "You must... ".

| ✅ **Do**                                          | ❌ **Don't**                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Turn on **show pricing** to give access to reports | You need to turn on **show pricing** to give access to reports |
