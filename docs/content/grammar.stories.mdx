# Grammar

This page defines the grammar and punctuation rules for writing at Jobber.
These rules ensure our content is consistent, clear, and easy to scan across
the product.

<br />

## Capitalization

Use sentence case for almost all product content, with the exception of
instances where all-caps is a stylistic decision (i.e. MON WED TUE as calendar
weekday headers).

This means in general, capitalize only the first letter of the content unless
there is a proper noun (such as a person's name) involved. This applies to:

- Headings and titles
- Body copy
- Card headers
- Menu options
- List items

Jobber features such as jobs, quotes and invoices don't count as proper nouns.
They shouldn't be capitalized.

### Names

Respect user input for names and do not force capitalization. For example, names
like “LaGrange”, “DeAndre”, and “dos Santos” all carry meaning, and we should
not impose a standardized structure that omits these nuances.

### Buttons

Button labels should be title-cased. This means in general, capitalize all words
with the exception of:

- Articles (a, an, the)
- Coordinating conjunctions (but, for)
- Prepositions (at, by, to, etc.)

| ✅ **Do**            | ❌ **Don't**           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Approve and Schedule | Approve and schedule   |
| Create a Quote       | Create A Quote         |

<br />

## Contractions

Contractions help keep Jobber's tone conversational, and make our content easier to
scan for SPs. They should be used.

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                        |
| --------------------------------| ----------------------------------- |
| Can't, couldn't, you're, it's   | Can not, could not, you are, it is

<br />

## Headings

Headings and subheadings are titles and subtitles that can refer to specific sections.

When writing a heading, try to keep it short. SPs are busy, and need to understand the 
content of a page or section quickly. Don't try to communicate technical details in the 
headline, leave that to the body copy.

Start by addressing the general thought, then post-headline, move on to the particulars.

#### Start with the general idea

Use the heading to name the **section** or **task**. Save specifics for the
body copy. This improves scanning and makes screens easier to reuse.

| ✅ **Do**            | ❌ **Don't**                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Invoice details      | Invoice for Anna Smith, May 14, $620 |
| Schedule options     | Schedule the job for next Thursday   |
| Payment history      | Payments received this month         |

#### Be clear

Headings should be easy to understand at a glance. Avoid vague, overly
friendly, or conversational phrases — they slow people down.

| ✅ **Do**         | ❌ **Don't**             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Job history       | Where you've been        |
| Add a new client  | Let’s get you set up!    |
| Quote overview    | Ready to win the work?   |


#### Keep it short and scannable

Headings should be easy to read on mobile and in motion. Avoid repeating
screen names, filler phrases, or full sentences.

| ✅ **Do**              | ❌ **Don't**                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create invoice         | This screen lets you create an invoice      |
| Upcoming appointments  | Your upcoming appointments are listed below |
| Add line item          | Add a line item to the quote                |

### Subheadings

Subheadings can be useful when a heading requires further context. They should always
offer real help, not filler. Just because a layout has a subheading, it doesn't mean
it should be used.

Only use subheadings when they:
- Clarify something that’s not obvious from the heading  
- Add meaningful guidance to a task or section  
- Help reduce the need for extra body copy

**Example**:

If you were introducing the concept of reviews for SPs, where Jobber can automate
asking SPs for a review upon a completion of a job, you wouldn't put the technical
aspect of automation in the heading, that would be saved for the subheading.

<p> Heading: Ask your clients for reviews </br>
Subheading: Jobber can ask your clients for reviews on your behalf, at a time of your choice </p>

For more guidance on how to structure headings and subheadings, you can

<br />

## Lists

Use lists to make instructions or content easy to scan. SPs often work in 
fast-moving situations, so these rules have been added with keeping lists
clear and readable in mind.

The two main ways to organise lists in Jobber are with bullet points or numbers.
In some instances there are also sentenced based lists. Follow these rules to 
achieve consistency when adding or editing a list.

### Bullet point list

Use a bullet point list when the list items don't require a specific order. 
Bullet point lists should be introduced with a colon. Don't put periods 
at the end of items if every item is one sentence.

**Example** where periods are not required:

All Connect features plus:

- Advanced quote customization
- Track costs with job costing
- Automated quote follow-ups

If one or more of the items is more than one sentence long, all items should end
with a period.

**Example** where periods are required:

Here’s what a client sees after accepting a quote:

- A confirmation message. It tells them you'll be in touch to schedule the job.
- A payment summary with any required deposit.
- A prompt to create a client account, if they haven't already.

### Numbered list

Use numbered lists when **order matters**, such as creating an invoice
from a completed job. Follow the same rules on colons and periods as bullet 
point list.

**Example**:

To create an invoice from the job page:

1. Tap more actions and select create invoice
2. Review the line items and costs
3. Tap send to email it to the client

### Sentence list

Occasionally you may want to structure a list with a sentence. These are
rarer than bullet point and numbered lists, but they can be useful in
describing a sequence or laying out the impact of an action.

Try to limit the amount of items in a sentence list, if it becomes hard to scan
consider a bullet point or numbered list.

Use an oxford comma to help communicate that the last two items of the list are
seperate. 

| ✅ **Do**                                       | ❌ **Don't**                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Change images, tagline, and contact information | Change images, tagline and contact information |

<br />

## Pronouns

Default to addressing SPs with "you", we don;t usually speak on their behalf with "I" or "my".

| ✅ **Do**              | ❌ **Don't**         |
| -----------------------| -------------------- |
| Your average job value | My average job value |

Use "I" when SPs need to declare something, this is usually related to a legal requirement.

| ✅ **Do**                           | ❌ **Don't**                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| I agree to the terms and conditions | You agree to the terms and conditions |

When referring to Jobber, feel free to use "we" and "we're". Avoid using "Jobber" wherever
possible, we should be happy to take ownership rather than talking in the third person.

| ✅ **Do**                                      | ❌ **Don't**                           |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| We've made improvements to your scheduled view | Jobber has improved your schedule view |

<br>

## Punctuation

These rules are in place so that punctuation can be applied consistently across Jobber.
Consistent use of punctuation will make the product feel more cohesive for SPs.

<br />

## Ampersands

Don't use ampersands in the product. They don't save much space, don't look great, and
they draw attention to the most irrelevant part of the sentence.

| ✅ **Do**            | ❌ **Don't**         |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Review and Send      | Review & Send        |
| Approve and Schedule | Approve & Schedule   |

<br />

## Commas

As stated with sentence lists, we use oxford commas at Jobber to help establish that the
last two items are separate. They should be used in lists of three items or more, unless
you're doing a bullet point list or a numbered list.

<br />

## Exclamation marks

Avoid exclamation marks in nearly all scenarios. There should be an extremely high threshold for the
use of exclamation marks to ensure the genuine moments of excitement aren't diluted.

Most of Jobber is not exclamation worthy. Even when a user completes something important, like:
- Sending a quote or invoice
- Scheduling a job
- Collecting a deposit
- Turning on Jobber Payments
- Signing up for Marketing Suite

These are normal workflows, not celebrations. They should be acknowledged
professionally, not enthusiastically.

| ✅ **Do**                  | ❌ **Don't**                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Quote sent                 | You sent the quote!              |
| Job scheduled              | Your job is booked!              |
| Payment received           | You got paid!                    |

There are more experimental areas such as trial where exclamation marks may be used to try and
generate excitement and enthusiasm for Jobber. Even in these cases, they should be limited to
one per page to focus the excitement on one specific area.

<br />

## Hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes

Use dashes thoughtfully. Each has a specific role, and misusing them can
make content harder to scan or understand for SPs.

| **Type**       | **Use for**               | **Example**                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Hyphen (-)     | Compound modifiers         | Full-service job                                 |
| En dash (–)    | Ranges and numeric spans   | Jan 2–Jan 5                                      |
| Em dash (—)    | Last-resort clarification  | Payment failed — update your billing information |

### Hyphens

Use hyphens to join words that act as a single modifier before a noun.
They help clarify meaning and reduce ambiguity.

| ✅ **Do**                | ❌ **Don't**              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Full-service job         | Full service job          |
| One-time cleanup         | One time cleanup          |
| Real-time tracking       | Real time tracking        |

Do not use hyphens when the compound comes **after** the noun.

> ✅ This job is full service.  
> ❌ This job is full-service.

### En dashes ( – )

Use en dashes for **ranges** especially in time, date, and dollar amounts.
No spaces on either side.

| ✅ **Do**               | ❌ **Don't**           |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Jan 2–Jan 5             | Jan 2 - Jan 5          |
| 2:00 PM–4:00 PM         | 2:00PM - 4:00PM        |
| $200–$500               | $200 - $500            |

En dashes are also used when **expressing a relationship** between values.

> The visit window is 8:00 AM–12:00 PM.  
> The client–contractor agreement includes scope and payment terms.

### Em dashes ( — )

Use em dashes **only when absolutely necessary**, typically as a last resort
to break up a sentence for readability or emphasis. As AI (over)uses the Em dash,
it's important to ensure all content produced by AI has been reviewed. Otherwise
Jobber content will look and sound like it has been purely AI generated.

They should **not** be your go-to for style or tone. Often, a clearer option
is to split the sentence.


| ✅ **Do**                                             | ❌ **Don't**                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| The quote was approved. You can now schedule the job. | The quote was approved — you can now schedule the job. |

<br />

## Multiplication

Use the `×` symbol to indicate multiplication whenever possible, rather than an
`x`.

| **✅ Do**   | **❌ Don't** |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 12 × $48.00 | 12 x $48.00  |

<br />

## Parentheses 

Restrict to when you need to communicate that some information or tasks are optional, or if you
want to highlight a particular action is recommended. In these cases, just use the word, rather
than overload SPs with information.

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ask for reviews (recommended)   | Ask for reviews (recommended for businesses like yours)    |

<br />

## Periods

Don't use a period in microcopy such as error messages, list items, or form
instructions. Headings don't need a period as they should be restricted to one sentence.
In microcopy generally, don't use a period unless what you're writing is more than one sentence long.

| ✅ **Do**        | ❌ **Don't**      |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Enter your email | Enter your email. |

<br />

## Question marks

Question marks should be avoided. They create uncertainty, take up
space, and increase decision-making effort for SPs, especially in fast-moving
contexts like job scheduling, invoicing, or follow-ups.

#### Don’t use question marks in confirmation modals

Confirmation modals should state what’s about to happen, not ask for
permission. Framing the action as a question forces us into over long and
confusing button labels like “Yes, do the action”.

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                               |
| ------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------  |
| Archive this job                | Are you sure you want to archive this job? |
| Delete client                   | Delete this client?                        |

#### Don’t use them in headlines or body copy

Headlines and hero copy should be clear and declarative, not speculative or
“salesy.” Avoid phrases like “Ready to…” or “Want to…”.

| ✅ **Do**                          | ❌ **Don't**                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Cut down on admin work            | Ready to cut down on your admin work? |
| Track time from anywhere          | Want to track time from the field?    |
| Book more jobs automatically      | Need to book more jobs?               |

#### Say what’s happening rather than what might happen

Even if you’re presenting a choice, **state the outcome**. This helps SPs
make quick, confident decisions, and keeps button text clear and specific.

| ✅ **Modal heading**              | ❌ **Modal heading**                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Cancel this visit                 | Are you sure you want to cancel?      |
| Remove team member from schedule  | Remove this team member?              |

<br />

## Quotation marks

Quotation marks can be helpful to clearly identify exact text that came from a client,
user, or file. This could include job notes, filenames, custom inputs, or copied
phrases.

#### Where to use quotation marks in Jobber

Use quotation marks when you're referencing exact input, especially in:

- File and attachment names
- Client-submitted phrases

#### Use quotes for client input, filenames, or copied phrases

Only use quotation marks when you’re showing exactly what the user or client
entered. Not to add emphasis.

| ✅ **Do**                                             | ❌ **Don't**                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| The client wrote: “Please use the back door.”        | The client wrote: Please use the back door. |
| File uploaded: “invoice_1023.pdf”                    | File uploaded: invoice_1023.pdf             |

#### Use curly quotes, not straight quotes

For the sake of consistency, always use smart (typographic) quotation marks — “ and ” — in all content.
Avoid straight quotes (" or ').

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| “Approved by client”            | "Approved by client"        |
| “Please avoid the driveway”     | 'Please avoid the driveway' |

#### Punctuation goes inside the quotes

In most cases, place periods and commas **inside** the quotation marks. This
keeps the sentence flowing and avoids awkward phrasing.

| ✅ **Do**                                       | ❌ **Don't**                               |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| The client said: “We’ll be home after 5.”      | The client said: “We’ll be home after 5”.   |

<br />

## Spelling

We use American spelling in Jobber as this is where most of our SPs are based.

| ✅ **Do**      | ❌ **Don't**    |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Labor          | Labour          |
| Customize      | Customise       |
| Canceled       | Cancelled       |

<br />

## Numbers

Use numbers, don't spell them out.

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                       |
| --------------------------------| ---------------------------------- |
| 14                              | Fourteen                           |
| You have 5 jobs scheduled today | You have five jobs scheduled today |

#### Use commas

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                       |
| --------------------------------| ---------------------------------- |
| 140,000                         | 140 k                              |

#### Use the En dash ( – ) 

As stated in the hyphens section, use an En dash when you want to show a numerical
range and don't use a space.

| ✅ **Do**                       | ❌ **Don't**                       |
| --------------------------------| ---------------------------------- |
| Between 10-15                   | Between 10 - 15                    |

#### Abbreviation

Don't abbreviate numbers when there's a decimal place involved. It's unlikely within
Jobber, a platform that deals in quotes and invoices, that the numbers after a decimal
place are going to be irrelevant. There is no need to put a decimal place if the post decimal
place value is zero (.00).

As stated, don't use shorteners such as "k", this makes Jobber seem less focused on accuracy.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |
| $3,345.34 | $3,345       |
| $32,000   | $32 k        |

#### Hyphens

Use a hyphen with phone numbers. Don't use spaces.

| ✅ **Do**    | ❌ **Don't**   |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| 912-790-5542 | (912) 790-5542 |

<br />

## Time

SPs can choose between 12 hour and 24 hour time formats in their settings, so this guidance
isn't based on which one Jobber prefers. This is just how to display each of the formats.

For both formats, use a colon (:) rather than a period "11:40"

### 12 Hour

12 hour time should refer to AM or PM. Go with uppercase , and don't use punctuation.

- Include a space between the last number "Scheduled for 11:40 AM"
- Use the En dash for ranges, and make sure AM or PM is included in both times "10 AM–11.40 AM"

| ✅ **Do**          | ❌ **Don't**           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 2:00 PM            | 2 pm                   | 
| 11:40 AM           | 11.40 AM               | 
| 11:40 AM–12:20 PM  | 11.40 A.M–12.20 P.M    | 

### 24  Hour

The 24 hour format uses the same rules as the 12 hour format, there's just
no need to add AM or PM, as it's self explanitory. Remember that times before
10:00 require a zero at the start "09:59"

| ✅ **Do**          | ❌ **Don't**            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 02:00              | 2:00 AM                 | 
| 19:40              | 19:40 PM                | 

### Time duration

Display hours, minutes and seconds when a timer is actively running.

| ✅ **Do** | ❌ **Don't** |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 0:04:31   | 0:04         |

Display hours and minutes rounded up when referring to a record of time.

| ✅ **Do**   | ❌ **Don't** |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 1 hr 21 min | 1:21:21      |


### Time unit standards

Use these time unit abbreviations based on available space and context.
Keep styling consistent across a screen or component.


| **Unit** | **Full**   | **Abbreviated** | **Condensed**  |
|----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Seconds  | seconds    | sec             | s              |
| Minutes  | minutes    | min             | m              |
| Hours    | hours      | hr              | h              |
| Days     | days       | days            | d              |

#### General rules

- Use **full words** when space allows  
  > 4 hours and 12 minutes.

- Use **abbreviated form** in dense UIs or mobile  
  > 4 hr 12 min

- Don’t mix styles within the same string  
  > ✅ 2 hr 10 min
  > ❌ 2 h 10 min

#### ✅ Time range formatting

Use standard punctuation and spacing for time unit standards.

| ✅ **Do**         | ❌ **Don't**                        |
|------------------|------------------------------------- |
| 1 hr 15 min      | 1hr 15minutes                        |
| 45 minutes       | 45 min *(if space allows full word)* |

<br />

## Dates

Separate date and time by a comma and avoid any additional punctuation.

| ✅ **Do**                | ❌ **Don't**         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| December 5 2022, 7:00 AM | Dec 5, 2022, 7:00 AM |

Use the full month where possible, if space is limited, go with the 
3-letter abbreviation. Don't use additional punctuation with years.
Don't use indicators after numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

| ✅ **Do**                | ❌ **Don't**         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| December 5 2025          | December 5 '25       |

When communicating a date range, as with other ranges, use the En dash ( – ) rather than a 
hyphen. Spaces either side of the En dash are permitted for date ranges where the month is
communicated in both dates. If the range overlaps a year, it needs to be indicated.
