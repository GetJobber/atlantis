# Interaction

Interactive states provide feedback to the user in a predictable way to help
them predict what will happen when they engage with Jobber.

## State change

State changes are used to inform the user that an interaction is about to, is,
our has taken place.

### Web

The primary examples for web are hover and focus.

<Canvas>
  <Card header="Interactive element example" url="#">
    <Content>
      <Text>This card has examples of hover and focus states for the web</Text>
      <InputText placeholder="Inputs change too" />
    </Content>
  </Card>
</Canvas>

<Disclosure title="CSS implementation">
    Atlantis components come with these states handled, but if you're extending or
    creating custom elements, this is the general pattern used to achieve an "Atlantis"
    interactive state.

    ```css

    .myElement {
    background-color: var(--color-surface);
    /* apply consistent transitions */
    transition: all var(--timing-base) ease-in;
    cursor: pointer;
    /* hides the default browser focus ring while maintaining compatibility with "high contrast" modes */
    outline: transparent;
    }

    /* use :focus-visible instead of :focus to provide appropriate feedback to keyboard users

without adding visual noise for mouse users \*/ .myElement:hover,
.myElement:focus-visible {  
 background-color: var(--color-surface--hover); }

    .myElement:focus-visible {
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-focus);
    }
    ```

## Mobile

The most common interactive state in mobile is `pressed`.
