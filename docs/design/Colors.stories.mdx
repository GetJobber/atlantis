# Colors

Color can provide a visual cue for users to navigate and understand an
interface.

Atlantis is built with a
[semantic layer](https://dev.to/ynab/a-semantic-color-system-the-theory-hk7)
overtop of a base palette. Use the semantic color values defined in the usage
guidelines whenever possible to ensure you are using colors for their intended
purpose.

## Accessibility

Color should never be the single means of conveying information in an interface.
Use labels, iconography, or hints for assistive technology alongside color to
ensure your content can be understood by everyone.

## Design & usage guidelines

### Typography

Typographic elements in Jobber should use consistent colors to ensure
readability.

#### Heading

<Swatch colors={[`--color-heading`]} />

Headings have a bold, high-contrast color to cement their hierarchy.

#### Text

<Swatch colors={[`--color-text`, "--color-text--secondary"]} />

A slightly softer color is used for body text for greater readability.

Text that is relevant but less important ("secondary") can be lower-contrast to
suggest its' reduced importance. This color should only be used when there is
more important text content already present.

##### Text--Reverse

<Swatch
  colors={[`--color-text--reverse`, "--color-text--reverse--secondary"]}
/>

When used against a [reversed surface](#surface--reverse), reversed text should
be used to maintain readability.

Reverse text also has a secondary value following the same rules outlined for
standard secondary text.

### Interactions

Use these colors in buttons and form controls to communicate the presence and
meaning of interaction. In cases such as [Buttons](/components/Button) where the
interactive color is functioning as a background color or the text color, the
alternative color should be `--color-surface` so that the label matches the
theme of the application's background.

#### Interactive

<Swatch colors={[`--color-interactive`, "--color-interactive--hover"]} />

The default color used for interactive elements.

##### Interactive--Subtle

<Swatch
  colors={[`--color-interactive--subtle`, "--color-interactive--subtle--hover"]}
/>

Use for interactive elements that should be less visually pronounced, such as an
icon action in main navigation, or buttons to dismiss or cancel a workflow.

##### Interactive--Background

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-interactive--background",
    "--color-interactive--background--hover",
  ]}
/>

Use for the background of interactive elements to ensure separation from the
surface they appear on.

#### Destructive

<Swatch colors={[`--color-destructive`, "--color-destructive--hover"]} />

Use to signify that an interaction will destroy something in the users' account
or workflow.

#### Disabled

<Swatch colors={[`--color-disabled`, "--color-disabled--secondary"]} />

Use to signify that an interactive element is disabled.

Use `secondary` when a disabled element needs more than one color to be readable
in a disabled state; for example, a button's background and label colors must be
different.

#### Focus

<Swatch colors={["--color-focus"]} />

Used by the `--shadow-focus` property to indicate that an element has received
focus. Avoid using `--color-focus` directly on UI elements.

### Status

Use these colors in labels, icons, filters, alerts, and other elements where
color can add meaning to the state of the system or an item in the system.

All status colors have a main color, a surface color, and an on-surface color.
The on-surface color should be used for an element when it sits inside of an
element with the status' surface color to maintain a cohesive tone and ensure
sufficient color contrast.

#### Critical

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-critical",
    "--color-critical--surface",
    "--color-critical--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Action required; user must see this status to be unblocked.

#### Warning

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-warning",
    "--color-warning--surface",
    "--color-warning--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Action _may_ be required as a consequence of current state.

#### Success

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-success",
    "--color-success--surface",
    "--color-success--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

No action required; an action has completed successfully.

#### Informative

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-informative",
    "--color-informative--surface",
    "--color-informative--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

No action required; but helpful to know about.

#### Inactive

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-inactive",
    "--color-inactive--surface",
    "--color-inactive--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

No action required; not part of an active workflow.

### Surfaces

Surfaces are the background-colors of almost every element in Jobber. Overlays
act as supplementary surfaces that mask areas of the interface to adjust visual
focus.

#### Surface

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-surface",
    "--color-surface--hover",
    "--color-surface--active",
  ]}
/>

Most elements in Jobber have a light surface to indicate their nearness to the
user; if interactive, they have a hover color and an active color to indicate
state.

#### Surface--Background

<Swatch
  colors={["--color-surface--background", "--color-surface--background--hover"]}
/>

A slightly darker surface gives a receded appearance relative to main surfaces.

#### Surface--Background--Subtle

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-surface--background--subtle",
    "--color-surface--background--subtle--hover",
  ]}
/>

Use when you need a surface that's distinct from the main `surface` without
appearing _too_ receded.

#### Surface--Reverse

<Swatch colors={["--color-surface--reverse"]} />

Use a reversed surface when a strong contrast is needed with the rest of the
application.

#### Overlay

<Swatch colors={["--color-overlay"]} />

Use to mask an area of the interface to promote focus to a foreground action,
such as a [Modal](/components/Modal)'s appearance. Overlay includes built-in
opacity values.

#### Overlay--Dimmed

<Swatch colors={["--color-overlay--dimmed"]} />

A transparent version of [Surface](#surface), this masks an area of the
interface to indicate inactivity (i.e. waiting for updates). Overlay--Dimmed
includes built-in opacity values.

### Borders

Defining the edges of elements on the same elevation plane, border colors are
the subtle maintainers of layout structure. Learn more about borders in our
[Borders guide.](/design/borders)

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-border",
    "--color-border--section",
    "--color-border--interactive",
  ]}
/>

Most borders should use `--color-border` for subtle definition.

Use `--color-border--section` where other bordered content is being further
sectioned, such as table headers or list sections.

Use `--color-border--interactive` for interactive elements to ensure accessible
contrast.

### Workflow

These colors are associated with steps of the home services workflow. These
should be used sparingly and only on elements that are directly related to the
workflow.

#### Requests and assessments

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-request",
    "--color-request--surface",
    "--color-request--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Requests and assessments use orange to convey a "warm handoff" from the service
consumer to the service provider.

#### Quotes

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-quote",
    "--color-quote--surface",
    "--color-quote--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Quotes use pink to suggest an increased likelihood of the service provider
winning the work.

#### Jobs and visits

<Swatch
  colors={["--color-job", "--color-job--surface", "--color-job--onSurface"]}
/>

Jobs are green because of their core association to Jobber, which has
historically used some shade of green for branding.

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-visit",
    "--color-visit--surface",
    "--color-visit--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Visits inherit the job color as they are closely related to jobs.

#### Invoices and payments

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-invoice",
    "--color-invoice--surface",
    "--color-invoice--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Invoices are blue as this is a common color associated with banking and finance.

<Swatch
  colors={[
    "--color-payments",
    "--color-payments--surface",
    "--color-payments--onSurface",
  ]}
/>

Payments inherit the invoice color as they are closely related to invoices.

#### Tasks

<Swatch
  colors={["--color-task", "--color-task--surface", "--color-task--onSurface"]}
/>

Tasks use a deeper shade of blue than invoices and the two rarely share
interfaces as tasks are generally isolated to scheduling.

### Brand

Use these colors to represent the Jobber brand visual language.

#### Brand

<Swatch colors={["--color-brand"]} />

The primary color associated with our brand, from website to ads to product; AKA
"Jobber Green".

#### Brand--Highlight

<Swatch colors={["--color-brand--highlight"]} />

Use to highlight an element in a way that aligns with our website. Use with
caution, it's _bright!_

## Base colors

<Disclosure
  title={
    <Text>
      This is the underlying color palette that powers our semantic system.
      Direct use of base colors should be avoided, as they do not respond to
      theming or systemic changes.
