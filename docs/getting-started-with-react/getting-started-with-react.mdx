# Getting Started with React

## Things to know.

<!--
- We will reference Typescript in this guide.
  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html
  - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app
  - Why Typescript?
- We will reference functional components. Older class components are still
  around and you will see them in some guides but we should prefer functional
  components.

## What is React

At its core React is simply a JavaScript view library layer. It provides us with
a way to define and render view components. It also aids with tracking and
re-rendering changes to data that the components are representing.
