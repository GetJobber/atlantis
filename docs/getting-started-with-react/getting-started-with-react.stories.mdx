# Getting Started with React

## Things to know.

<!--
- We will reference Typescript in this guide.
  - https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html
  - https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app
  - Why Typescript?
- We will reference functional components. Older class components are still
  around and you will see them in some guides but we should prefer functional
  components.

## What is React

At its core React is simply a JavaScript view library layer. It provides us with
a way to define and render view components. It also aids with tracking and
re-rendering changes to data that the components are representing.

## What is a Component

Much as a function in programing allows you to encapsulate, test and reuse logic
a React Component allows you to encapsulate, test and reuse pieces of your UI.
In this way you can think of a React Component as a view function. This even
carries into how components are themselves written.

```tsx
interface MessageProps {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly yell: boolean;
}

export function Message({ text, yell }: MessageProps) {
  if (yell) {
    text = text.toLocaleUpperCase();
  }

  return <p>{text}</p>;
}
```

```tsx
<Message text="foo" yell={false} /> // → <p>foo</p>
<Message text="bar" yell={true} /> // → <p>BAR</p>
```

> **Note:**
>
> In this example you may have noticed some HTML like code embedded in the
> JavaScript. This is called
> [JSX ↗︎](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
>
> This example also uses a
> [Typescript interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
> to enforce the shape of the component's props.

There are a few things going on in the example above. Lets break them down:

| Artifact                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `interface MessageProps`       | The `props` define options that a component will accept. In the examples above you ca see how calling the component with different props results in different output.                                                                                   |
| `export function Message`      | This function is the Message component. The `export` here means that we can import the component into another file. If you are writing a local component you don't need the `export`.                                                                   |
| `{ text, yell }: MessageProps` | There are two parts to this. Starting on the right `MessageProps` indicates that this funciton takes a parameter of type `MessageProps`. On the left the `{ text, yell }` unpacks the parameter into local variables.                                   |
| `return <p>{text}</p>`         | Every React component will return an [element](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) or [fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html). (Note the [fragment short hand syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html#short-syntax).) |

## It's Components All the Way Down

In React everything is a component. A typical page will consist of one top level
component representing the main view. Then within that page you will break down
smaller components. Brad Frost covers this break down very well with
[Atomic Design ↗](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

When you are writing a front end using React each of the levels he talks about
are represented by components functions.

## Composing Components

As mentioned above a lot of the power of React comes from being able to build
components out of other components. Lets take a look at an example on how to do
that.

For this example we are going to build a card that allows you to enter a topic
and then search for a related gif.

<Canvas>
  <ExampleWithHooks>
    {() => {
      const [topic, setTopic] = useState();
      const [url, setURL] = useState();
      return (
        <Card title="Gif Gift">
          <Content>
            <InputText value={topic} onChange={setTopic} placeholder="Topic" />
            <Button label="Search" fullWidth={true} onClick={gifSearch} />
            <center>{url && <img src={url} />}</center>
          </Content>
        </Card>
      );
      async function gifSearch() {
        setURL(loadingGIF);
        setURL(await getGIF(topic));
      }
    }}
  </ExampleWithHooks>
</Canvas>

> **Note:**
>
> This example assumes the presence of a constant `const loadingGIF: string;`
> which will contain the URL to a loading gif as well as a function
> `function getGIF(topic: string): Promise<string>;` that will return a promise
> resolving to a url.

### Breaking it Down

```tsx
const [topic, setTopic] = useState();
const [url, setURL] = useState();
```

The example starts with
[defining two stateful variables using the `useState` hook ↗](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#state-hook).
`useState` returns a pair. The first of which is the current value and the
second is a setter that allows you to update the value. For this component we
need one stateful value to represent the content of the input and another to
store the result of the `gifSearch`.

---

```tsx
return (
  <Card title="Gif Gift">
...
```

The next section is the return value which will return the TSX defining our
component. In here you can see that our `GifGift` component is composed of the
following other react components:

- [Card](../?path=/docs/components-card--card)
- [Content](../?path=/docs/components-content--content)
- [Button](../?path=/docs/components-button--button)
- [InputText](../?path=/docs/components-inputtext--input-text)

If you look at the docs for the above components you can see how the different
props they expose allow us to customize their behaviour given the needs of our
`GifGift` component.

> **Note:**
>
> Normally when you use a component you would need to import it. The docs for
> each component start with the import path for that component.
>
> ```ts
> import { Button } from "@jobber/components/Button";
> ```
>
> This means for the above example we would need to import the following
>
> ```ts
> import { Card } from "@jobber/components/Card";
> import { Content } from "@jobber/components/Content";
> import { Button } from "@jobber/components/Button";
> import { InputText } from "@jobber/components/InputText";
> ```

---

```tsx
async function gifSearch() {
  setURL(loadingGIF);
  setURL(await getGIF(topic));
}
```

The final part of our example defines the custom actions needed to power our
component. In this case the action when the user clicks on the **Search**
button. Here we call the `setURL` setter to show the `loadingGIF`. Then, we call
`setURL` awaiting the async response of `getGIF`.
