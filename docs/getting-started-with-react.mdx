# Getting Started with React

## Things to know.

<!--
- We will reference Typescript in this guide. -
  https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html -
  https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#creating-a-typescript-app -
  Why Typescript?
- We will reference functional components. Older class components are still
  around and you will see them in some guides but we should prefer functional
  components.

## What is React

At its core React is simply a JavaScript view library layer. It provides us with
a way to define and render view components. It also aids with tracking and
re-rendering changes to data that the components are representing.

## What is a Component

Much as a function in programing allows you to encapsulate, test and reuse logic
a React Component allows you to encapsulate, test and reuse pieces of your UI.
In this way you can think of a React Component as a view function. This even
carries into how components are themselves written.

```tsx
interface MessageProps {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly yell: boolean;
}

export function Message({ text, yell }: MessageProps) {
  if (yell) {
    text = text.toLocaleUpperCase();
  }

  return <p>{text}</p>;
}
```

```tsx
<Message text="foo" yell={false} /> // → <p>foo</p>
<Message text="bar" yell={true} /> // → <p>BAR</p>
```

> **Note:** In this example you may have noticed some HTML like code embedded in
> the JavaScript. This is called
> [JSX ↗︎](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

As you can see here the component takes parameters in the form of `Props` and
then returns a response in the form of a view fragment. You can also see how
calling the component with different props results in different output.

## It's Components All the Way Down

In React everything is a component. A typical page will consist of one top level
component representing the main view. Then within that page you will break down
smaller components. Brad Frost covers this break down very well with
[Atomic Design ↗](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

When you are writing a front end using React each of the levels he talks about
are represented by components functions.
