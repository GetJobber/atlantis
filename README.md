## What is Atlantis?

> Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design
> reusableâ€”reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value
> of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components,
> guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number
> of applications.

Atlantis is a design system for [Jobber](https://getjobber.com). The primary
objective for Atlantis is to provide a system of reusable components to help
developers to quickly build beautiful and consistent interfaces for our users.
